# Style

## Why Style Matters

Style serves as a powerful tool for personal and professional success, extending far beyond surface-level appearances. Your clothing choices directly influence your confidence and performance, with research showing that dressing well improves self-esteem and task completion <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-confidence')">i</span>. The workplace impact is particularly significant, with employers reporting that professional dress increases promotion likelihood by up to 55% in some industries <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-workplace')">i</span>.

Style also functions as a sophisticated communication system, conveying messages about competence, social status, and personal identity before you ever speak <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-communication')">i</span>. Understanding and leveraging this visual language enables more effective social navigation whilst building authentic self-expression through deliberate choices that reflect your values and aspirations.

## Style Values

Your optimal approach to style depends on what aspects of clothing and fashion you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

This guide focuses on clothing choices, accessories, and overall aesthetic presentation – how you choose to dress and present yourself to the world.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Style Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/style/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Professional Success (30%)

### Comfort & Functionality (20%)
Prioritising clothing that supports daily activities, physical comfort, and practical needs.
