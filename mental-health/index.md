# Mental Health

## Why Mental Health Matters

Mental health serves as the foundation that influences virtually every aspect of human functioning and wellbeing. Beyond managing distress, good mental health dramatically enhances daily performance, decision-making quality, relationship satisfaction, and physical health outcomes <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('workplace-impact')">i</span>. The connections between psychological wellbeing and physical health are profound and bidirectional <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('mind-body-connection')">i</span>, whilst social relationships and mental health create reinforcing cycles that shape overall life satisfaction <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('social-connection')">i</span>.

These relationships extend far beyond individual experience. Mental health challenges create significant workplace productivity losses <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('economic-impact')">i</span>, affect family dynamics and caregiving capacity, and influence community engagement and social cohesion. The systems you establish for mental health management directly impact your cognitive performance, emotional resilience, stress tolerance, and ability to adapt to life's inevitable challenges.

## Mental Health Values

Your optimal approach to mental health depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances three core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Mental Health Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/mental-health/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Professional Treatment & Support (40%)
Working with qualified mental health professionals and building strong support networks. This includes therapy, counselling, medication when appropriate, and leveraging relationships for mental health support. People who prioritise this value focus on expert guidance and community-based approaches to mental wellness.

### Self-Management & Independence (35%)
Developing personal skills and practices to manage your own mental health independently. This includes mindfulness, journaling, exercise, and other self-directed interventions that don't require ongoing professional support. Those who prioritise this value focus on building internal capabilities and self-reliance.

### Integration & Holistic Approach (25%)
Viewing mental health as interconnected with all other life areas and addressing it through lifestyle, relationships, purpose, and environment rather than as an isolated domain. People who prioritise this value see mental wellness as emerging from overall life balance and meaning.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that mental health management is challenging for most people, with significant barriers to accessing and maintaining effective approaches. Approximately 20% of adults experience mental illness each year, but only about half receive treatment. Around 30% of American adults have accessed therapy since 2020, though many discontinue due to various barriers. For self-management approaches, only 17% of adults practice meditation regularly, and most people lack structured emotional regulation skills despite widespread recognition of their importance. These patterns mean that even basic mental health management represents higher population achievement than might initially be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**Professional Treatment & Support**: Recognise personal mental health patterns and know when professional support might be beneficial <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-professional')">i</span>

**Integration & Holistic Approach**: Recognise how lifestyle factors (sleep, exercise, social connection) directly impact your mental state and adjust accordingly <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-integration')">i</span>

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**Professional Treatment & Support**: Actively work with mental health professionals when needed and maintain supportive relationships that contribute to psychological wellbeing <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-professional')">i</span>

**Self-Management & Independence**: Practice regular mental health maintenance activities and effectively manage emotional responses in most stressful situations <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-self-management')">i</span>

**Integration & Holistic Approach**: Systematically address mental health through lifestyle choices and create environments that support psychological wellbeing <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-integration')">i</span>

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)

**Self-Management & Independence**: Demonstrate consistent emotional regulation across various life stressors and adapt mental health strategies based on changing circumstances <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-self-management')">i</span>

**Integration & Holistic Approach**: Create coherent lifestyle approaches where all life areas mutually support psychological flourishing <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-integration')">i</span>

### Level 5: Mastery (99.9th percentile capability)

**Professional Treatment & Support**: Access and integrate advanced therapeutic approaches while maintaining sophisticated support systems that enhance rather than merely sustain mental health <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-professional')">i</span>

**Self-Management & Independence**: Maintain optimal psychological functioning across major life transitions and challenges, with advanced self-awareness and adaptive capacity <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-self-management')">i</span>

**Integration & Holistic Approach**: Achieve seamless integration where mental health enhancement emerges naturally from life design rather than requiring separate interventions <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-integration')">i</span>
