name: "Swimming Training"
description: "Structured aquatic exercise involving regular pool sessions with progressive training protocols including technique refinement, endurance building, and strength development. Swimmers typically train 3-6 times per week for 45-90 minutes per session, focusing on stroke mechanics, cardiovascular conditioning, and muscular endurance through various distances and intensities. Results in cardiovascular fitness and body composition changes typically become noticeable within 4-6 weeks, with significant improvements in technique and endurance developing over 3-6 months of consistent practice."

   pbs: 8
   pbs_reasoning: "Meta-analyses show swimming reduces all-cause mortality by 28% and cardiovascular disease risk by 41% (Swimmers live 3-5 years longer on average). Large cohort studies demonstrate significant reductions in diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. The low-impact nature provides joint protection while delivering full-body cardiovascular and muscular benefits comparable to running with less injury risk."
   isr: 85
   isr_reasoning: "Extensive research from multiple large-scale studies and systematic reviews consistently demonstrate health benefits. The Cooper Institute longitudinal studies (40+ years) and multiple meta-analyses provide high-quality evidence with large sample sizes showing reliable health improvements across diverse populations when proper training volume is maintained."
   uar: 60
   uar_reasoning: "Pool access limitations and scheduling constraints create significant barriers. Studies show 40-50% dropout rates in the first 6 months due to facility access, time commitments, and technical learning curve. However, those who establish routine often maintain long-term adherence due to low injury rates and joint-friendly nature."

 fitness.performance:
   pbs: 9
   pbs_reasoning: "Swimming develops exceptional cardiovascular efficiency, with elite swimmers achieving VO2 max values of 65-75 ml/kg/min. Training produces superior lung capacity (vital capacity 15-25% above average), enhanced cardiac output, and full-body muscular endurance. Olympic swimmers demonstrate near-maximum human aquatic performance capabilities, with technique and conditioning transferring to other athletic endeavors."
   isr: 75
   isr_reasoning: "Well-documented training adaptations occur reliably in coached athletes. Studies consistently show significant VO2 max improvements (15-25%), stroke volume increases, and muscular power gains. However, technique complexity means performance gains require proper instruction and progressive programming for optimal results."
   uar: 45
   uar_reasoning: "Performance-focused training requires 4-6 sessions weekly with structured progression, creating high adherence barriers. Elite training demands are substantial, with studies showing 60-70% dropout rates from competitive programs. Success requires access to coaching, facilities, and significant time commitment that limits long-term adherence for recreational athletes."

 fitness.appearance:
   pbs: 7
   pbs_reasoning: "Swimming produces distinct physique adaptations including broad shoulders, lean muscle mass, and low body fat percentages. Studies show 8-15% body fat reduction over 6 months with significant improvements in muscle definition, particularly upper body. Elite swimmers exhibit classic V-taper physiques, though genetic factors influence achievable aesthetic outcomes."
   isr: 70
   isr_reasoning: "Body composition changes are well-documented in controlled studies, with consistent fat loss and muscle tone improvements. However, dramatic physique transformation requires high training volumes and dietary discipline. Research shows reliable but moderate aesthetic changes for recreational swimmers, with more dramatic results requiring competitive-level commitment."
   uar: 55
   uar_reasoning: "Aesthetic goals require consistent 4-5 weekly sessions plus dietary changes. Appearance-focused swimmers show better adherence than performance athletes (less intensity required) but face pool access barriers. Studies indicate 45-55% maintain programs long enough for significant aesthetic changes due to gradual visible progress providing motivation."

 fitness.enjoyment:
   pbs: 8
   pbs_reasoning: "Swimming provides unique meditative qualities through rhythmic breathing and movement, often described as 'flow state' activity. Studies show high satisfaction rates among regular swimmers due to stress relief, joint comfort, and full-body engagement. The aquatic environment offers therapeutic psychological benefits and escape from daily stressors, with many swimmers reporting it as their preferred exercise modality."
   isr: 80
   isr_reasoning: "Research consistently demonstrates high satisfaction and psychological benefits among regular swimmers. Studies show significant stress reduction, mood improvement, and exercise enjoyment scores. The low-impact nature and meditative qualities create reliable positive experiences for those who develop basic competency."
   uar: 65
   uar_reasoning: "Swimmers who overcome initial technical barriers and establish routine often develop strong exercise adherence due to enjoyment factor. However, pool access and scheduling create ongoing challenges. Studies show bimodal distribution - either high long-term adherence (5+ years) or early dropout, with 65% of those swimming regularly for 6+ months continuing long-term."
