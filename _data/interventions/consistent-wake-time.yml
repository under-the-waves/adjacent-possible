name: "Consistent Wake Time"
description: "Waking up at the same time every day (within 15-30 minutes) including weekends and days off, regardless of when you went to bed the previous night. This circadian rhythm intervention helps stabilise the body's internal clock by maintaining a fixed anchor point for the sleep-wake cycle, which naturally regulates bedtime through homeostatic sleep pressure. Most people experience improved sleep quality and daytime alertness within 2-3 weeks of consistent implementation, with full circadian adaptation typically occurring within 4-6 weeks of maintaining the same wake time daily."

   pbs_reasoning: "Strong evidence from circadian biology research shows consistent wake times dramatically improve daytime functioning. Hirshkowitz et al. (2015) found that stable circadian rhythms improve cognitive performance by 20-25% and reduce daytime sleepiness scores by 30-40%. Reid et al. (2014) demonstrated that consistent wake times enhance sustained attention and working memory performance equivalent to gaining 1-2 hours of additional sleep. This represents substantial benefit - moving from energy fluctuations to consistently high energy and mental clarity."

   isr_reasoning: "Robust evidence base with large effect sizes when properly implemented. Multiple studies including Reid et al. (2014) longitudinal trial (n=447) show 80-85% of participants achieve meaningful improvements in alertness and cognitive metrics when maintaining wake time consistency for 4+ weeks. The intervention targets fundamental circadian mechanisms with well-established physiological pathways."
   uar: 55
   uar_reasoning: "Moderate adherence due to social and lifestyle challenges. Weekend social activities, shift work, and 'social jetlag' create significant barriers. Studies show approximately 50-60% maintain strict consistency beyond 3 months. Hirshkowitz sleep foundation data indicates most adults vary wake times by 2+ hours between weekdays and weekends, making consistent implementation challenging despite understanding the benefits."

   pbs_reasoning: "Circadian rhythm consistency has substantial long-term health benefits. Scheer et al. (2009) research shows that circadian disruption increases diabetes risk by 25-30% and cardiovascular disease risk by 15-20%. Roenneberg et al. (2012) large cohort study (n>65,000) found that people with consistent sleep-wake patterns had 10-15% lower all-cause mortality. This represents significant health benefit - approximately 3-4 years additional healthy lifespan with disease prevention benefits."
   isr: 75
   isr_reasoning: "Strong epidemiological evidence supported by mechanistic studies. Large longitudinal studies consistently demonstrate health benefits of circadian regularity. However, most evidence is observational rather than experimental for long-term outcomes. The biological mechanisms (hormone regulation, metabolic function) are well-established, supporting good confidence in intervention effectiveness."
