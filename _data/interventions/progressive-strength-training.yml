name: "Progressive Strength Training"
description: "A systematic approach to resistance training where individuals gradually increase the weight, repetitions, or sets over time to continuously challenge muscles and promote adaptation. Training typically involves compound movements (squats, deadlifts, bench press) and isolation exercises performed 3-4 times per week for 45-75 minutes per session, with progressive overload applied weekly or bi-weekly. Results for strength gains become noticeable within 4-6 weeks, while significant physique changes typically occur after 12-16 weeks of consistent training."

  fitness.health:
    pbs: 8
    pbs_reasoning: "Meta-analyses show resistance training reduces all-cause mortality by 15-20% and provides substantial benefits for bone density, metabolic health, and sarcopenia prevention. Studies demonstrate 10-15% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk and significant improvements in insulin sensitivity. While substantial, this represents ~25% of maximum possible longevity benefit on the logarithmic scale."
    isr: 85
    isr_reasoning: "Extensive high-quality evidence from multiple large RCTs and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate health benefits when resistance training protocols are followed properly. The physiological mechanisms are well-understood and reliably reproduced across diverse populations."
    uar: 35
    uar_reasoning: "Gym membership retention rates show ~80% dropout within 5 months. Long-term resistance training adherence studies indicate only 30-40% maintain consistent training beyond one year due to time constraints, injury concerns, and motivation challenges."

  fitness.performance:
    pbs: 9
    pbs_reasoning: "Resistance training is fundamental to elite athletic performance across most sports. Studies show 20-40% strength gains in novices, 10-20% in intermediate trainees, and 5-10% in advanced athletes. Combined with sport-specific training, can elevate performance to elite competitive levels, representing ~50% of maximum benefit."
    isr: 90
    isr_reasoning: "Strength gains from progressive resistance training are among the most reliable and well-documented adaptations in exercise science. Multiple systematic reviews confirm consistent strength improvements when programs follow progressive overload principles."
    uar: 45
    uar_reasoning: "Athletes and serious fitness enthusiasts show higher adherence rates (~40-50%) due to clear performance goals and often external accountability (coaches, teammates). However, the demanding nature still limits long-term adherence for recreational users."

  fitness.appearance:
    pbs: 8
    pbs_reasoning: "Resistance training can produce dramatic physique transformations through muscle hypertrophy (8-20% muscle mass increases documented) and body composition changes. Studies show 10-15% reduction in body fat percentage when combined with appropriate nutrition. Represents substantial but not complete transformation potential."
    isr: 80
    isr_reasoning: "Muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training is well-established with consistent results across studies. However, physique transformation also depends heavily on nutrition compliance and genetic factors, introducing more variability than pure strength gains."
    uar: 30
    uar_reasoning: "Physique transformation requires sustained effort over 6-12+ months with high training consistency and dietary discipline. Real-world adherence data shows only 25-35% maintain the necessary consistency for significant visual changes."
    anchor_type: "subjective"
    anchor_max: null
    anchor_unit: null
    anchor_description: "Complete physique transformation"

  fitness.enjoyment:
    pbs: 7
    pbs_reasoning: "Studies show resistance training significantly improves mood, self-efficacy, and provides satisfaction through measurable progress. However, it's typically not reported as a primary source of life satisfaction for most individuals, unlike intrinsically enjoyable activities. Represents meaningful but moderate benefit."
    isr: 70
    isr_reasoning: "Research consistently shows psychological benefits from resistance training, including reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. However, individual variation in enjoyment response is high, and some find the activity inherently unpleasant despite benefits."
    uar: 25
    uar_reasoning: "Enjoyment-based adherence is particularly challenging as resistance training can be uncomfortable and repetitive. Many individuals require external motivation rather than intrinsic enjoyment to maintain consistency long-term."

resources:
  upfront_cost: 100
  upfront_cost_reasoning: "Basic workout clothing and athletic shoes ($80-120). Optional equipment like lifting belt could add $30-50 but not required initially."
  ongoing_cost: 30
  ongoing_cost_period: "month"
  ongoing_cost_reasoning: "Budget gym membership ($20-40/month) represents the minimum ongoing expense. Higher-end facilities or additional supplements are optional."
  upfront_time: 8
  upfront_time_reasoning: "Learning basic compound movements and gym orientation (6-8 hours). Additional personal training is beneficial but not required for minimum implementation."
  ongoing_time: 3
  ongoing_time_period: "week"
  ongoing_time_reasoning: "Minimum effective dose: 3 sessions of 45-60 minutes each per week, including warm-up and workout. Travel time to gym not included."

prerequisites:
  - "Medical clearance for individuals over 40 or with pre-existing health conditions"
  - "Access to resistance training equipment or gym facility"
  - "Basic understanding of proper lifting form or access to qualified instruction"
