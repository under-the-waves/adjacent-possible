# Participatory Leisure

## Why Participatory Leisure Matters

Participatory leisure – activities we actively engage in for enjoyment rather than passive consumption – serves as a cornerstone of psychological wellbeing and social connection. Regular engagement in meaningful leisure activities reduces stress hormones by up to 68% and significantly improves life satisfaction <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('stress-reduction')">i</span>. Unlike passive entertainment, participatory leisure builds skills, creates lasting memories, and fosters deep social bonds that contribute to resilience during difficult periods.

People with rich leisure lives report 40% higher life satisfaction and demonstrate better stress management <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('life-satisfaction')">i</span>, whilst those who maintain diverse leisure interests show significantly better cognitive function as they age <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('cognitive-function')">i</span>. Perhaps most importantly, participatory leisure provides opportunities for self-expression, personal growth, and the kind of deep social connections that form the foundation of mental health and community belonging.

## Participatory Leisure Values

Your optimal approach to leisure depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances three core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.
