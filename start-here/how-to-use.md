# How to Use This Site

This guide explains different ways to navigate the content based on your goals.

For detailed definitions of terminology used throughout the framework, see the [Key Terms]({{ site.baseurl }}/start-here/key-terms) page.

## Understanding Values and Personalisation

Each guide includes core values that help customise recommendations to what matters most to you. However, values work differently across life areas.

Some areas use **outcome-focused values** describing what you want to achieve. For example, fitness values focus on results like health, performance, or appearance. People naturally think about fitness in terms of goals, so values reflect these motivations.

Other areas use **approach-focused values** describing how you prefer to work. Financial planning might include "detailed control and tracking" versus "simple, automated systems." Here, people have strong preferences about method – some want to understand every transaction while others prefer set-and-forget approaches.

This ensures recommendations align with both your goals and your preferred working style. The framework will eventually allow you to adjust value priority settings, automatically customising recommendations across all life areas.

## Different Ways to Navigate

### For Beginners

If you want a comprehensive approach to personal development:

1. **Start with Values** to understand how your core priorities shape other decisions
2. **Take the Assessment** to identify current levels across life areas and spot opportunities  
3. **Review your Dashboard** for personalised recommendations based on your situation
4. **Choose 1-2 life areas** where you have both high potential impact and genuine interest
5. **Focus on Level 2** in chosen areas, as these typically provide the best return on investment

### For Targeted Changes

If you already know which areas need attention, navigate directly to [Life Areas]({{ site.baseurl }}/life-areas/) and explore the [5-Level Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/5-levels/) to understand the progression system.

## General Tips

Each level includes realistic estimates for time investment and financial costs to help you plan improvements within available resources and compare intervention efficiency.

**Start small and build systematically** – focus on 1-2 life areas initially rather than attempting everything simultaneously. **Prioritise fundamentals** – Level 2 interventions typically provide 80% of available benefits for 20% of the effort. **Adapt to your context** – the framework provides evidence-based starting points, but adjust specifics based on your circumstances and constraints.
