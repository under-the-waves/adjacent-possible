# Key Terms

This glossary defines the key concepts and terminology used throughout the Adjacent Possible framework.

## Core Framework Terms

**Life Areas** – The 14 major domains covering every aspect of human flourishing: Values, Purpose, Knowledge, Learning, Environment, Finances, Career, Health, Relationships, Wellbeing, Identity, Productivity, Security, and Leisure. Each represents a distinct area where improvement is possible and measurable.

**Levels** – The five-stage progression system within each life area:
- **Level 1: Awareness** – Assessment and planning only, requiring no habit changes or financial investment
- **Level 2: Fundamentals** – Core basics applying the 80/20 principle, typically requiring 3-5 hours weekly and ~$200 investment
- **Level 3: Proficiency** – Capabilities that exceed 80% of the general population
- **Level 4: Excellence** – Capabilities that exceed 95% of the general population
- **Level 5: Mastery** – Top 1% capabilities requiring significant time and resource investment

**Values** – The 3-5 core priorities that determine which interventions are most suitable for you within each life area. Values help personalise recommendations based on what matters most to you and how you prefer to work.

## Implementation Terms

**Benchmarks** – Specific, measurable indicators that define what each level looks like in practice. These help you assess your current position and understand what progress means in concrete terms.

**Actions** – One-time tasks, projects, or learning activities that help you reach the benchmarks for a particular level. Examples include setting up systems, purchasing equipment, or acquiring new skills.

**Habits** – Ongoing routines, practices, and behaviours that maintain your capabilities at each level and support continued progress. These become the sustainable foundation of improvement.

**Interventions** – The complete set of actions and habits recommended for each level, representing proven approaches for improvement in that life area based on evidence and practical experience.

**Benefits** – The expected improvements, advantages, and positive outcomes you gain by reaching each level, backed by research evidence and validated through practical application.

## Personalisation Terms

**Outcome-Focused Values** – Values that describe what you want to achieve in a particular life area. For example, fitness values might focus on health, performance, or appearance goals.

**Approach-Focused Values** – Values that describe how you prefer to work on a particular area. For example, some people prefer detailed control and tracking while others want simple, automated systems.

**Resource Constraints** – The limitations of time, money, and attention that influence which interventions are practical for your situation. The framework helps optimise recommendations within these constraints.

## Assessment and Planning Terms

**Current Level** – Your present capabilities and practices within a life area, determined by comparing your situation against the benchmarks for each level.

**Highest-Leverage Opportunities** – Life areas or specific interventions that offer the greatest potential return on investment given your values, current situation, and available resources.

**Cross-Domain Synergies** – Situations where progress in one life area supports or amplifies improvement in other areas, creating compound benefits from your efforts.

**Meta-Skills** – Fundamental capabilities like learning systems, habit formation, and productivity that enhance your ability to improve across multiple life areas simultaneously.
