# Key Terms

This glossary defines the key concepts and terminology used throughout the Adjacent Possible framework.

**Actions** – One-time tasks, projects, or learning activities that help you reach the benchmarks for a particular level. Examples include setting up systems, purchasing equipment, or acquiring new skills.

**Approach-Focused Values** – Values that describe how you prefer to work on a particular area. For example, some people prefer detailed control and tracking while others want simple, automated systems.

**Benchmarks** – Specific, measurable indicators that define what each level looks like in practice. These help you assess your current position and understand what progress means in concrete terms.

**Benefits** – The expected improvements, advantages, and positive outcomes you gain by reaching each level, backed by research evidence and validated through practical application.

**Constraints** – The limitations of time, money, and attention that influence which interventions are practical for your situation. The framework helps optimise recommendations within these constraints.

**Habits** – Ongoing routines, practices, and behaviours that maintain your capabilities at each level and support continued progress. These become the sustainable foundation of improvement.

**Interventions** – The complete set of actions and habits recommended for each level, representing proven approaches for improvement in that life area based on evidence and practical experience.

**Levels** – The five-stage progression system within each life area, from basic awareness to top 1% capabilities. See the [5-Level Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/5-levels/) page for complete details.

**Life Areas** – The subcategories within each life domain. For example, the Health domain includes Fitness, Nutrition, Sleep, and Preventative Health as separate life areas. See all [Life Areas]({{ site.baseurl }}/life-areas/).

**Life Domains** – The 14 broad categories covering every aspect of human flourishing: Values, Purpose, Knowledge, Learning, Environment, Finances, Career, Health, Relationships, Wellbeing, Identity, Productivity, Security, and Leisure.

**Outcome-Focused Values** – Values that describe what you want to achieve in a particular life area. For example, fitness values might focus on health, performance, or appearance goals.

**ROI Approach** – Return on investment thinking applied to personal development. Given what's important to you in life, which actions can be expected to deliver the most value for the least expenditure of your time, money and attention?

**Values** – The 3-5 core priorities that determine which interventions are most suitable for you within each life area. Values help personalise recommendations based on what matters most to you and how you prefer to work.
