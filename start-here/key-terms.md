# Key Terms

This glossary defines the key concepts and terminology used throughout the Adjacent Possible framework, organised to show how they relate to each other.

## Framework Structure

**Life Domains** – The 14 broad categories covering every aspect of human flourishing: Values, Purpose, Knowledge, Learning, Environment, Finances, Career, Health, Relationships, Wellbeing, Identity, Productivity, Security, and Leisure.

**Life Areas** – The subcategories within each life domain. For example, the Health domain includes Fitness, Nutrition, Sleep, and Preventative Health as separate life areas. See all [Life Areas]({{ site.baseurl }}/life-areas/).

**Levels** – The five-stage progression system within each life area, from basic awareness to top 1% capabilities. See the [5-Level Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/5-levels/) page for complete details.

**Benchmarks** – Specific, measurable indicators that define what each level looks like in practice. These help you assess your current position and understand what progress means in concrete terms.

## Values and Personalisation

**Values** – The 3-5 core priorities that determine which interventions are most suitable for you within each life area. Values help personalise recommendations based on what matters most to you and how you prefer to work.

**Outcome-Focused Values** – Values that describe what you want to achieve in a particular life area. For example, fitness values might focus on health, performance, or appearance goals.

**Approach-Focused Values** – Values that describe how you prefer to work on a particular area. For example, some people prefer detailed control and tracking while others want simple, automated systems.

## Implementation and Practice

**Interventions** – The complete set of actions and habits recommended for each level, representing proven approaches for improvement in that life area based on evidence and practical experience. See the [Intervention Database]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/intervention-database/) for detailed examples.

**Tools** – Specific websites, books, podcasts, companies, and services that Adjacent Possible has evaluated and recommends for implementing interventions. While interventions describe general approaches to improvement, tools are particular products or resources that can help you put those approaches into practice.

**Actions** – One-time tasks, projects, or learning activities that help you reach the benchmarks for a particular level. Examples include setting up systems, purchasing equipment, or acquiring new skills.

**Habits** – Ongoing routines, practices, and behaviours that maintain your capabilities at each level and support continued progress. These become the sustainable foundation of improvement.

**Benefits** – The expected improvements, advantages, and positive outcomes you gain by reaching each level, backed by research evidence and validated through practical application.

**Constraints** – The limitations of time, money, and attention that influence which interventions are practical for your situation. The framework helps optimise recommendations within these constraints.

## Scoring and Evaluation

**Potential Benefit Score (PBS)** – The theoretical maximum benefit an intervention could provide for a specific domain (e.g., health, performance) under ideal conditions, scored from 0 to 10 on a logarithmic scale.

**Expected Benefit Score (EBS)** – The Potential Benefit Score adjusted for realistic probability of success, accounting for factors like adherence rates and individual circumstances.

**Weighted Total Benefit (WTB)** – The final personalised score for an intervention, calculated by multiplying each Expected Benefit Score by the user's priority weightings and summing across all domains.

**ROI Approach** – Return on investment thinking applied to personal development. Given what's important to you in life, which actions can be expected to deliver the most value for the least expenditure of your time, money and attention?
