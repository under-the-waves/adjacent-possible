## Level 3: Solid Sleep Optimisation

This level represents sleep capabilities that exceed 80% of the population.

### Benchmarks
- **Sleep Duration and Consistency**: 
  - Regular 7-8 hour sleep duration (most nights)
  - Relatively consistent bedtime and wake time (±30 minutes)
  - Weekend schedule not drastically different from weekdays

- **Sleep Environment**: 
  - Reasonably dark and quiet bedroom
  - Comfortable temperature maintained
  - Decent mattress and pillows that suit your preferences

- **Sleep Preparation**: 
  - Simple wind-down routine (20-30 minutes)
  - Limited caffeine in afternoons/evenings
  - Some awareness of how food affects your sleep

- **Sleep Quality**: 
  - Generally refreshed upon waking most mornings
  - Able to fall back asleep within 15-20 minutes if awakened
  - Rarely need naps due to poor nighttime sleep

**Benefits**: At Level 3, sleep becomes a reliable foundation rather than a limiting factor. Research shows that consistent, sufficient sleep at this level supports improved mood regulation, steady energy levels throughout the day, and enhanced cognitive performance compared to the average population.

### Actions
- Purchase a better pillow matched to your sleep position ($30-60)
- Establish a simple bedtime routine you enjoy and can maintain

- Reduce screen time in the hour before bed (or use blue light blockers)
- Get some form of natural light exposure in the morning
- Limit caffeine after lunch
- Have a simple pre-sleep ritual that helps you wind down

### Costs

- **Money**: $100-250 total
  - Better pillow: $30-60
  - Simple white noise machine: $20-40
  - Comfortable eye mask: $15-25
  - Basic sleep tracking app (premium version): $0-40/year
