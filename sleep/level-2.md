## Level 2: Fundamental Sleep Foundations

This level represents the core fundamentals that deliver maximum benefit for minimal effort—the 80/20 principle applied to sleep.

### Benchmarks
- **Sleep Duration and Consistency**: 
  - Regular 7+ hour sleep duration on most nights
  - Consistent wake time (within 30-minute window) including weekends
  - Bedtime that allows sufficient sleep before required wake time
  - Limited use of alarm for waking (natural awakening most days)

- **Sleep Environment**: 
  - Bedroom darkness achieved (blackout solutions for windows)
  - Comfortable sleeping temperature (65-68°F/18-20°C for most people)
  - Reduced noise disruption with basic solutions
  - Comfortable, supportive mattress and pillows

- **Sleep Preparation**: 
  - Simple wind-down routine established (30 minutes)
  - Screen exposure reduced 1 hour before bed
  - Stimulant cutoff implemented (caffeine before 2pm)
  - Basic relaxation technique identified and practiced

- **Circadian Alignment**: 
  - Morning light exposure within first hour of waking
  - Sleep schedule aligned with basic chronotype preference
  - Weekend schedule within 1 hour of weekday timing
  - Recognition of shift work or jet lag impacts when applicable

- **Sleep Quality**: 
  - Reduced nighttime awakenings
  - Easier sleep onset (falling asleep within 30 minutes)
  - Morning waking feeling somewhat refreshed
  - Reduced daytime sleepiness

**Benefits**: This level establishes the fundamental foundation for quality sleep with minimal effort. Studies have shown that these basic interventions can improve sleep efficiency by 10-15% while reducing sleep onset time by an average of 15 minutes ([source](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8618)). Research has found that consistent wake times alone significantly improved subjective sleep quality and daytime alertness, even without changing total sleep duration ([source](https://www.sleephealthjournal.org/)). These foundational changes create the critical momentum that makes continued progress significantly easier.

### Actions (Quick Wins)
- Purchase a quality sleep mask and earplugs
- Optimize bedroom temperature control (adjust thermostat, add/remove blankets)
- Create a simple 15-minute wind-down routine with non-screen activities
- Establish a consistent wake time and morning light exposure pattern
- Remove or silence electronic devices in the bedroom
- Set a daily caffeine cutoff time

### Habits
- Maintain consistent wake time (even weekends) within 30-minute window
- Implement screen curfew 60 minutes before intended sleep
- Practice a simple relaxation technique (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation)
- Get natural light exposure within 60 minutes of waking
- Limit caffeine to morning hours (before 2pm)
- Create and use a dedicated wind-down routine
