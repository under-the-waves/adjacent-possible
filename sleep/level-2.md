# Sleep
## Level 2: Foundations

This level focuses on the few key changes that deliver the majority of sleep benefits for minimal effort.

### Benchmarks
- Sleep 7+ hours most nights
- Create a dark, cool sleeping environment
- Reduce evening stimulation
- Establish a consistent wake time

**Benefits**: These four fundamental changes address the primary factors affecting sleep quality for most people. Research shows these basic interventions can improve sleep efficiency by 10-15% while reducing sleep onset time by an average of 15 minutes.

### Actions (The Critical Few)
1. **Darken your bedroom completely**
   - Install blackout curtains OR use a quality sleep mask ($15-25)
   
2. **Optimize bedroom temperature**
   - Set thermostat to 65-68°F/18-20°C OR use fan/window to cool room
   
3. **Implement a "digital sunset"**
   - Stop using screens 60 minutes before bed OR use blue-blocking glasses

4. **Set a consistent wake time**
   - Choose a sustainable wake time and stick to it (even weekends)

### Habits (Just These Three)
- Wake up at the same time every day (±30 minutes)
- Avoid screens 60 minutes before bed
- Keep bedroom cool and dark for sleep

### Costs
- **Time**: 1 hour (for environment modifications) + 15 minutes daily (for wind-down)
- **Money**: $50-75 total
  - Sleep mask: $15-25
  - Basic fan (if needed): $20-30
  - Blue-blocking glasses (optional): $15-25
- **Tools**: Alarm clock (non-phone if possible)
