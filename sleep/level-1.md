## Level 1: Awareness and Basic Planning

This level requires no habit changes or financial investment—just assessment and planning.

### Benchmarks
- **Sleep Duration and Consistency**: 
  - Understand your current sleep patterns and timing
  - Know how much sleep you typically get
  - Recognize the consistency (or lack thereof) in your schedule
  - Identify major discrepancies between weekday/weekend patterns

- **Sleep Environment**: 
  - Assess your bedroom for obvious disruptors
  - Understand basic environmental factors affecting sleep
  - Recognize potential improvements to sleep space
  - Identify sources of noise, light, and temperature issues

- **Sleep Preparation**: 
  - Understand your current pre-sleep activities
  - Identify potential disruptors in evening routine
  - Recognize stimulant consumption patterns
  - Assess stress and anxiety factors affecting sleep onset

- **Circadian Alignment**: 
  - Determine your chronotype tendency (morning/evening preference)
  - Understand the concept of social jetlag
  - Recognize how your schedule aligns with natural tendencies
  - Identify major sources of circadian disruption

- **Sleep Quality**: 
  - Gauge your perceived sleep quality
  - Identify common disturbances during the night
  - Understand your typical wake patterns
  - Assess morning energy levels and recovery sensations

**Benefits**: At this level, you gain crucial self-awareness that eliminates guesswork and establishes direction. Understanding your starting point prevents misguided interventions that might not address your specific sleep challenges. Studies have shown that proper assessment is the foundation of effective sleep improvement ([source](https://aasm.org/)). This awareness phase also reduces "sleep anxiety" by replacing vague concerns with specific, actionable insights—an important first step since sleep-related anxiety itself can diminish sleep quality.
