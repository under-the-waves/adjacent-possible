# Food and Nutrition

## Why Food and Nutrition Matter

Food choices affect virtually every aspect of life, from physical health and longevity to cognitive function, environmental sustainability, and financial wellbeing. Beyond personal health, our food decisions carry significant ethical implications regarding animal welfare and environmental impact, with plant-forward diets generally associated with lower emissions and reduced animal suffering. Importantly, food is deeply intertwined with culture, pleasure, and social connection—optimising nutrition should enhance, not diminish, these aspects.

Good nutrition involves balancing science-based approaches with personal preferences and practical constraints. While Level 1 focuses on awareness and basic planning, Level 3 represents a sweet spot where most people can achieve excellent nutrition with reasonable effort. At the highest levels, individuals develop sophisticated systems that make optimal nutrition almost effortless through advanced knowledge and strategic decision-making.

## Food and Nutrition Values
There's no universal standard for optimal nutrition. Your approach depends on what aspects of food and eating you value most. This guide balances three core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations:

### Physical Wellbeing (45%)
Nutrition that supports bodily health and function. This includes nutrient adequacy, disease prevention, energy provision, digestive health, and metabolic balance. People who prioritize this value focus on food choices that deliver optimal nutrition for immediate function and long-term health, with particular attention to nutrient density and physiological effects.

### Pleasure & Connection (35%)
The sensory enjoyment and social aspects of food. This encompasses taste satisfaction, variety, cultural expression, and the role of food in relationships and community. Those who prioritize this value emphasize cooking skills that enhance flavor, meals as social experiences, and maintaining food traditions that connect us to others and our heritage.

### Ethical & Environmental Impact (20%)
The broader consequences of food choices on the planet and other beings. This includes sustainability considerations, carbon footprint, animal welfare, biodiversity, and fair labor practices. Those who prioritize this value focus on sourcing decisions, waste reduction, and choosing foods with lower environmental impact.

Your optimal approach will also be influenced by your metabolic individuality, cultural background, health conditions, taste preferences, cooking experience, schedule constraints, and local food access. This guide focuses on evidence-based principles that benefit most people across five core components: nutritional knowledge and application, taste and diversity, food sourcing and planning, preparation skills and efficiency, and food ecosystem management.

_Note: Your own priorities may differ from the weightings used in this guide. While these values can often be harmonized, there are occasional trade-offs—for example, some foods with optimal nutritional profiles might require more preparation time or have different taste profiles than more familiar options._
