    - "Can consistently commit 4.5 hours per week for at least 3 months"
    - "Willing to spend 2-4 weeks learning proper form before adding significant weight"
    - "Basic understanding that strength training requires progressive overload and patience"

daily_walking:

      justification_potential: "Excellent cardiovascular benefits with very low injury risk"
      justification_expected: "Accounting for 95% adherence rate due to low barrier to entry"
    performance:
      potential_score: 4.0
      expected_score: 3.8
      justification_potential: "Limited performance gains beyond basic cardiovascular fitness"
      justification_expected: "Accounting for 95% adherence, minimal skill requirements"
    appearance:
      potential_score: 3.5
      expected_score: 3.3
