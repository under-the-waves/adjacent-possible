# Media Diet

## What is a Media Diet?

A media diet encompasses all informational content you regularly consume – news articles, podcasts, newsletters, magazines, non-fiction books, documentaries, and online publications. This excludes entertainment media (which belongs in [consumptive leisure]({{ site.baseurl }}/consumptive-leisure/)), formal educational courses (which belongs in [learning]({{ site.baseurl }}/learning/)), and the systems you use to organise this information (which belongs in [information management]({{ site.baseurl }}/information-management/)). Your media diet shapes how well-informed you are about the world and provides the raw material for developing your [worldview]({{ site.baseurl }}/worldview/).

Unlike passive consumption driven by algorithms and notifications, a deliberate media diet involves conscious choices about what information to consume, when, and in what format to best serve your goals and cognitive wellbeing.

## Why Media Diet Matters

Your information consumption patterns profoundly influence your understanding of reality, decision-making quality, and cognitive performance. The average person encounters 34 GB of information daily – equivalent to watching six hours of television – yet most consume information reactively through social media feeds and push notifications <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('information-overload')">i</span>. This reactive approach often leads to fragmented understanding, anxiety from negative news cycles, and poor retention of valuable insights.

A well-curated media diet enhances decision-making across all life domains whilst reducing cognitive overhead and information anxiety <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('cognitive-benefits')">i</span>. Research demonstrates that people with intentional information consumption habits show improved focus, better long-term thinking, and more accurate understanding of complex issues <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('intentional-consumption')">i</span>. The compound effects are substantial – the information you consume today shapes the mental models you use for years to come.

## Media Diet Values

Your optimal approach to information consumption depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Media Diet Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/media-diet/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Information Quality & Depth (30%)
The accuracy, nuance, and intellectual rigour of consumed information. This includes prioritising books over articles, primary sources over summaries, expert analysis over hot takes, and comprehensive coverage over fragmented updates. People who prioritise this value invest time in fewer, higher-quality sources that provide deep understanding rather than broad coverage.

### Actionable Relevance (25%)
How directly the information supports decision-making and practical outcomes in your life. This includes career-relevant developments, investment insights, health discoveries, and information that changes behaviour or choices. Those who prioritise this value curate their consumption around information with clear utility for their specific circumstances and goals.

### Breadth & Discovery (25%)
Exposure to diverse perspectives, unexpected insights, and information outside your existing knowledge areas. This includes following curiosity into unfamiliar domains, consuming content from different cultural perspectives, and maintaining intellectual openness to ideas that might reshape your thinking. People who prioritise this value deliberately seek out information that challenges assumptions and expands mental models.

### Cognitive Efficiency (20%)
Optimising the retention-to-effort ratio and minimising cognitive overhead from information consumption. This includes choosing formats that match your processing style, avoiding redundant coverage, and consuming information at optimal timing and frequency. Those who prioritise this value focus on maximum informational value with minimal mental fatigue or wasted attention.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that most people consume information passively through algorithmic feeds, with only 20-30% actively curating their sources and less than 10% regularly engaging with long-form content. Common barriers include information overload, difficulty distinguishing quality sources, and lack of systematic approaches to information management. These patterns mean that even modest intentionality in information consumption represents higher population percentiles than might initially be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**Information Quality & Depth**: Recognise the difference between primary and secondary sources; understand your current mix of shallow vs deep content consumption <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-quality')">i</span>

**Actionable Relevance**: Identify which information sources have actually influenced your decisions in the past year; assess whether your current consumption aligns with your goals <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-relevance')">i</span>

**Breadth & Discovery**: Understand your information comfort zone and echo chambers; recognise areas where you lack diverse perspectives <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-breadth')">i</span>

**Cognitive Efficiency**: Track how much time you spend consuming information vs how much you retain; notice patterns of information overload or cognitive fatigue <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-efficiency')">i</span>

### Level 2: Foundation (80th percentile capability)

**Information Quality & Depth**: Regularly consume at least one high-quality source monthly; can distinguish between opinion and reporting <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-quality')">i</span>

**Actionable Relevance**: Have 2-3 information sources directly relevant to your career or major life areas; occasionally change behaviour based on information consumed <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-relevance')">i</span>

**Breadth & Discovery**: Deliberately expose yourself to at least one unfamiliar topic or perspective monthly; consume information from sources outside your usual political alignment <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-breadth')">i</span>

**Cognitive Efficiency**: Spend less than 2 hours daily on news and information; have basic systems to avoid duplicate coverage of the same stories <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-efficiency')">i</span>

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**Information Quality & Depth**: Read 12+ non-fiction books annually; regularly consume in-depth analysis rather than just headlines; can trace information back to primary sources when needed <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-quality')">i</span>

**Actionable Relevance**: Have curated information sources for each major life domain; regularly implement insights from information consumed; avoid information that provides no decision-making value <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-relevance')">i</span>

**Breadth & Discovery**: Systematically explore new domains quarterly; maintain information sources from multiple countries; comfortable engaging with ideas that challenge existing beliefs <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-breadth')">i</span>

**Cognitive Efficiency**: Optimised information consumption schedule that maximises retention; efficient methods for processing different content types; rarely experience information overload <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-efficiency')">i</span>

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)

**Information Quality & Depth**: Regularly engage with academic papers and primary research; read 25+ books annually across diverse domains; can quickly assess source credibility and bias <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-quality')">i</span>

**Actionable Relevance**: Information diet directly drives major life decisions; curated sources provide competitive advantages; systematic approach to filtering signal from noise <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-relevance')">i</span>

**Breadth & Discovery**: Actively seek contrarian viewpoints and edge cases; information consumption spans multiple cultural contexts; comfortable with high intellectual uncertainty <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-breadth')">i</span>

**Cognitive Efficiency**: Sophisticated systems for information processing and synthesis; optimal timing and format selection; information consumption enhances cognitive performance <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-efficiency')">i</span>

### Level 5: Mastery (99.9th percentile capability)

**Information Quality & Depth**: Contribute to information quality through expert networks; maintain relationships with primary sources; read 40+ books annually with high retention <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-quality')">i</span>

**Actionable Relevance**: Information diet provides substantial competitive advantages; others seek your perspective on information quality; systematic frameworks for evaluating information value <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-relevance')">i</span>

**Breadth & Discovery**: Information consumption leads to novel connections others miss; comfortable operating at knowledge frontiers; includes significant untranslated or specialist sources <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-breadth')">i</span>

**Cognitive Efficiency**: Information consumption seamlessly integrated with productive work; optimal cognitive load management; measurably enhanced decision-making quality <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-efficiency')">i</span>
