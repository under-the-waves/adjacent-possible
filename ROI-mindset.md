# ROI Mindsets

Everyone values certain things in their lives. Everyone has a limited amount of resources (time, money, attention) in which they can pursue what they value. Everyone has room to improve how they apply their limited resources to what they value.

## Return on Investment Thinking

To make decisions about where and how to best direct our resources, we can apply something like a Return On Investment (ROI) approach. Given what is important to me in life, what actions can be expected to accrue the most value for the least expenditure of my time, money and attention?

ROI thinking is usually best done over long timeframes. It often makes sense for me to take actions I don't particularly enjoy doing right now with the expectation that they will contribute to an overall life that I value. I study hard in university when I'm 20 to gain a meaningful career throughout my 30s and 40s. I save money now with the aim of reaching financial independence later.

This sort of thinking also leads to chains of instrumental goals. I might value having a long and healthy life where I maintain physical fitness into old age. To best achieve this, I should work to maintain my fitness in my 30s and avoid an unhealthy diet and poor sleep hygiene. To best maintain my fitness in my 30s, I might develop a workout routine involving strength and cardio exercises. To fulfill this routine, I might go to the gym this afternoon.

All of this is obvious: there are better and worse ways to achieve what we value in life, and our actions today are directed towards chains of instrumental goals that we hope will eventually achieve what we value.

And yet, imagine if you wrote a list of all actions you could complete within the next hour that would make your life overall go as well as possible. Perhaps you would begin a business plan for a start-up you always wanted to create. Perhaps you would book a cancer screening exam. Perhaps you would call your brother or sister to repair a broken relationship. There are likely a large number of areas of your life where things could be better, and you could take action in the next hour to effectively move towards improving them.

## Why Don't We Optimize Every Hour?

So why don't we spend every hour like this?

A key insight of the ROI approach is that we should spend more of our hours in this way. We have the ability to optimize towards what we value, and we have access to more tools and knowledge than any past generation of humans on how to most effectively make improvements. A change we initiate in the next hour could have long-lasting consequences. Our time is therefore precious.

At the same time, attempting to spend every hour making such changes would be completely unsustainable. An hour at the gym might not feel as high-ROI as an hour spent reading up on how to better balance my investment portfolio. A minute spent chatting to an uber driver might not feel as valuable as checking an online jobs board on my phone. But if I always sacrificed exercise and incidental social interaction in the pursuit of more 'optimizing' activities, I would quickly lose energy for everything else - not to mention that I would wreck my goal of a long and healthy life with meaningful social connection.

Perhaps more importantly, I would lose the value I gain from this moment if I treated every hour of my day as only worthwhile to the extent it helped me optimize towards later goals.

It seems clear that what has the greatest ROI in any particular moment is context-dependent. Sometimes, it makes sense for us to take a birds' eye view of our lives and what we value, identify areas for improvement, and take the most cost-effective action we can. At other times, what makes the most sense is to wholeheartedly give our time and attention to what is right in front of us. Ideally, what is right in front of us will be things we have previously decided to do because they effectively help fulfill a larger life goal - but often they won't be. Life is messy, plans go awry, and we have to wisely adapt as best we can.

## ROI Mindsets

For any given day, hour, or minute of my time, what would it mean to adopt a mindset that is both context-dependent and follows ROI principles? In other words, which mindsets would, if followed across different moments in daily life, tend to be most effective at advancing what I value in life?

By mindset, I mean answers to the following three questions for any given moment:
1. What should I be paying attention to?
2. What should I be optimizing for?
3. Which strategies or heuristics best help me optimize for that thing?

As an example, I cycle to work most days. This is an activity I have chosen because it contributes in a big-picture sense to a life I value: it saves me money; it maintains my cardio fitness; it reduces carbon pollution; and it is good for my mental health. At the same time, it takes 40 minutes five days a week. Given my broader decisions around where I live and work, it wouldn't make sense for me to forgo cycling to the office in order to spend 200 extra minutes a week optimizing other parts of my life. (At a minimum I would have to spend a big chunk of those 200 minutes commuting by other means, or else lose my job.)

However, cycling for me is not a particularly cognitively demanding activity. So what should my brain be doing while my legs are pedaling? What sort of mindset does it make the most sense for me to adopt?

Taking an ROI approach to this question, I know some people might be tempted to listen to a podcast while cycling. Surely it is better to be educated on some important topic than to be cognitively idle for 200 minutes each week? That argument may be compelling for some people and I have no problem with that. But I think a different mindset has a better ROI for me.

My ideal ROI mindset while cycling to work would be something like:
- **Pay attention to** my surroundings, including traffic, the road ahead, people and buildings.
- **Optimize for**:
  - **Safety**: A cycling accident could be life-threatening. The small amount of cognitive burden it takes to concentrate on riding safely is a great ROI, if it means I minimize the risk of such accidents.
  - **Speed**: Cycling faster is better for my cardio fitness and also reduces my commuting time.
  - **Enjoyment**: Cycling can be fun - the sun on your back and wind in your face, the technical challenge of navigating moving traffic, the incidental people-watching as you pass pedestrians going about their lives. Like anything, fun activities are less fun if you don't pay attention to them.
- **Use the following strategies/heuristics**:
  - Defensive cycling principles.
  - Safety and legality over speed. A 30 second faster commute is not worth breaking the law or risking my life.
  - Mindfulness techniques.

It is worth saying that I am almost never able to complete a commute exclusively adopting the above mindset. My thoughts wander, sometimes I sacrifice safety for speed, or I forget to enjoy the experience. But intentionality matters, and I think being specific about how I want to direct my attention during certain activities will make it more likely that I actually do.

## General Principles of ROI Mindsets

Once you have decided to do an activity, the ROI mindset usually answers the question: what is the best or most efficient way to do it?

For almost all activities, the answer to the 'attention question' will be: pay attention to the thing you are actually doing; don't try to multitask. In other words, a mindset of mindfulness will likely be a key component of high ROI across all activities. [Moreover, I believe that a particular kind of compassionate mindfulness - kindfulness? - could underwrite almost everything we do in life, and would have enormous expected ROI if properly developed. But that is a topic for another article.]

For many activities, we probably have a hierarchy of things we pay attention to and optimize for. When I'm grocery shopping, my attention might alternate between my shopping list, my plans for dinners that week, and the people and space around me. Optimizing the entire task becomes a game of effectively switching attention to different targets at different times, perhaps following some pre-established heuristics, e.g. in order to optimize for personal security, pay particular attention to the people around me when I have my phone and wallet out.

An ROI approach dovetails with the idea of constant improvement. This is particularly relevant for basic life tasks we have to do all the time. I've brushed my teeth twice a day every day since I was a child. Have I become an expert teeth brusher over this time? If not, why not? How about cooking, cleaning, eating, showering: do I already perform these tasks in a way that extracts all the value I can?

Sometimes the answer may be yes, in which case it might make sense to perform these tasks subconsciously while focusing on higher value things, such as podcasts, music, or conversation. But on closer examination, it may surprise us how many automatic tasks that we take for granted would actually benefit from closer attention - even leaving aside the general benefits of improved mindfulness. Who can say that their walking posture is beyond improvement? There is evidence that even breathing is an activity that most of us perform sub-optimally.

## Possible Objections

### Isn't the ROI mindset framework just another name for promoting mindfulness throughout our daily lives?

Yes, but I believe it does more than that. First, it provides further motivation to be mindful beyond the benefits normally ascribed to mindfulness. Let's say I have decided in advance that the single highest ROI thing I could be doing while cycling to work is to be mindful of my surroundings. Once I have realized that I have become distracted, I have a choice: return to the thought pattern I was in moments ago, or try again to pay attention again to my cycling. An explicit ROI mindset makes it harder for me to justify a decision to return to daydreaming.

Second, 'attention' is only one part of the framework. The real magic happens in the other two components: knowing what to optimize for in different daily contexts and deciding which strategies or heuristics to use. This is where we can take advantage of the vast resources already available online, including how to know what we value in the first place, think more rationally, make better predictions, have an impactful career, 'upgrade' different aspects of our lives, plan our next 12 months, and learn from communities already focused on optimizing specific subfields.

### Wouldn't this approach lead to over-optimization?

There are of course parts of life where optimization does not appear to be worth the benefits. It's easy to get caught up in measuring, and therefore optimizing, proxies of what we really value. But the purpose of the ROI mindset is not to put a number on everything. Instead, the goal is to pursue the things that really matter to us with greater intention and attention.

Additionally, it might surprise us at times where the line between useful and excessive optimization lies. As an example from the career planning website 80,000 Hours: "If good career planning can increase the positive impact you have with your career â€” or the satisfaction you get from it â€” by just 1%, then because a career is typically 80,000 hours long, it'd be worth spending 799 of those hours just planning."

A more granular example comes from the webcomic XKCD: if I perform a 30 minute task every week for over 5 years, it is worth spending as much as 21 hours figuring out how to shave off 5 minutes from that task. (Assuming of course that I'm optimizing for time.)

### What about time to just relax? If I'm focused on optimizing something every moment, when will I get to simply think and reflect on my life?

Time to relax, think and reflect is very important! These things are valuable to almost everyone, and also things that can be done in better and worse ways. An ROI mindset approach is not opposed to having down-time. On the contrary, it should help us do it better - by deliberately carving out time for leisure, avoiding low-quality digital distractions that make us feel worse afterwards, and pursuing activities like meditation and journaling that are more conducive to true reflection. If you decide that for you, an ROI mindset while walking along the beach means time alone with your thoughts, then great. Be intentional about that and don't let yourself feel guilty if you weren't paying attention to the scenery.
