# Body Image

## Why Body Image Matters

Body image profoundly influences psychological wellbeing, with research showing that one-quarter of our self-esteem is determined by how positively we view our bodies <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('self-esteem-research')">i</span>. Body image satisfaction affects daily functioning, romantic relationships, and overall life satisfaction, whilst body dissatisfaction is strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and eating disorders <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('mental-health-link')">i</span>. 

The way we perceive and feel about our physical selves extends beyond superficial concerns to impact confidence, social interactions, and willingness to engage in life activities <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('social-impact')">i</span>. Developing a positive relationship with your body creates a foundation for physical and mental wellbeing that supports achievement across all life domains.

## Body Image Values

Your optimal approach to body image depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

This guide focuses on how your body looks and feels without clothing considerations – including body composition, skin health, hair, posture, grooming, and body language.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Body Image Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/body-image/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Youthfulness & Vitality (35%)
Maintaining or enhancing a youthful, energetic appearance through body condition and grooming. This includes skin health, hair quality, posture, energy levels, and overall vitality. People who prioritise this value focus on interventions that make them look and feel younger, healthier, and more vibrant over time.

### Romantic Appeal (30%)
Developing physical attractiveness and body language that appeals to potential or current romantic partners. This encompasses body composition changes, grooming standards, confident movement, and physical presence. Those who prioritise this value focus on interventions that enhance their attractiveness in romantic contexts.

### Weight Management (20%)
Achieving desired changes in body composition, whether gaining muscle mass, losing body fat, or maintaining current weight. This includes both aesthetic and functional aspects of body size and shape. People who prioritise this value focus on interventions that help them reach their specific body composition goals.

### Body Confidence (15%)
Feeling comfortable, at home, and confident in your own body regardless of dramatic changes. This includes body acceptance, improved posture, confident movement, and reduced body-related anxiety. Those who prioritise this value focus on interventions that improve their relationship with their body rather than necessarily changing it.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals significant body image challenges across populations. Studies show that 75% of adults report body dissatisfaction, with higher rates in women (81%) compared to men (67%). Among teenagers, 37% feel upset and 31% feel ashamed about their body image, while one-third of adults have felt anxious or depressed because of body image concerns. Body image appears to have a more limited range of variation compared to domains like fitness or wealth - once someone achieves excellent body confidence and presentation, further distinctions become subtle, which may explain why Levels 4 and 5 represent very similar capabilities in this area.
