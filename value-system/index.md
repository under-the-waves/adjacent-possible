# Value System

## Why Value System Matters

A clear value system serves as the foundation for all meaningful decision-making and authentic living. Having well-defined values eliminates the endless deliberation that plagues many life choices, from career moves to relationship decisions to daily priorities <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('decision-efficiency')">i</span>. When you understand what truly matters to you, decisions become clearer and carry less regret because they align with your deeper principles.

Beyond decision-making, values clarification reduces the psychological stress of living inauthentically <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('authenticity-research')">i</span>, whilst providing the courage needed to act according to your principles even when facing social pressure or external expectations <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('moral-development')">i</span>. This alignment between inner values and outer behavior creates the foundation for genuine relationships, effective resource allocation, and reduced anxiety about life direction.

## Value System Values

Your optimal approach to values work depends on what aspects you prioritise most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Value System Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/value-system/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Practical Decision-Making (35%)
Having a values framework that actively improves daily choices and major life decisions. This emphasises values as a functional tool for resource allocation, career moves, and life direction, treating values as stable inputs to efficient decision processes. People who prioritise this value want clear guidance that reduces decision fatigue and increases confidence in choices.

### Comprehensive Insight (30%)
Deep understanding of your authentic values, including recognising inherited versus genuine values, understanding value hierarchies and trade-offs, and knowing when enough is enough for different values. This involves thorough values discovery and analysis to achieve clarity about what truly matters to you and why, assuming relatively stable core values once discovered.

### Authentic Expression (25%)
The courage to live in alignment with your discovered values even when they conflict with social expectations, family pressure, or external incentives. This focuses on identity integrity and congruence between inner beliefs and outer behaviour, prioritising being true to yourself over efficiency or social approval.

### Values Evolution (10%)
Viewing values as potentially changeable and being open to intentional value development through new experiences, reflection, and life transitions. This includes willingness to seek transformational experiences and regularly reassess whether current values still serve you, treating values work as ongoing growth rather than one-time discovery.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that most adults live with unexamined values inherited from childhood and culture. Studies on moral development suggest only 10-15% of adults engage in principled reasoning beyond social expectations. The demands of social conformity, fear of judgment, and discomfort with philosophical reflection mean that even basic values clarification represents higher population achievement than might be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**Practical Decision-Making**: Recognise that many daily choices involve value conflicts and that clearer values could improve decision quality <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-practical')">i</span>

**Comprehensive Insight**: Understand the difference between values you've inherited from family/culture versus those you've consciously chosen <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-insight')">i</span>

**Authentic Expression**: Identify specific situations where you act differently than your stated values due to social pressure or fear <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-authentic')">i</span>

**Values Evolution**: Recognise that values can legitimately change through life experiences and personal growth <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-evolution')">i</span>

### Level 2: Foundation (80th percentile capability)

**Practical Decision-Making**: Consistently use 3-5 core values to guide major life decisions like career choices, relationships, and significant purchases without extensive deliberation <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-practical')">i</span>

**Comprehensive Insight**: Distinguish between your intrinsic values (meaningful in themselves) and instrumental values (useful tools), with clear understanding of your top 3 intrinsic values <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-insight')">i</span>

**Authentic Expression**: Act according to personal values in most situations despite mild social pressure, even when it creates minor discomfort or disagreement <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-authentic')">i</span>

**Values Evolution**: Consciously update values based on major life experiences (parenthood, career changes, relationships) rather than unconsciously drifting <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-evolution')">i</span>

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**Practical Decision-Making**: Navigate complex decisions involving competing values systematically, understanding trade-offs and when to compromise versus hold firm across all life domains <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-practical')">i</span>

**Comprehensive Insight**: Understand your values hierarchy deeply, including which values dominate others in conflicts and recognition of "enough" thresholds for different values <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-insight')">i</span>

**Authentic Expression**: Maintain values-based behaviour even when facing significant social pressure, financial costs, or relationship strain <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-authentic')">i</span>

**Values Evolution**: Deliberately seek experiences that might challenge existing values, with regular reassessment of whether current values serve personal growth <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-evolution')">i</span>

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)

**Practical Decision-Making**: Make values-aligned decisions instinctively in most situations, with sophisticated frameworks for handling uncertainty and multiple stakeholder considerations <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-practical')">i</span>

**Comprehensive Insight**: Understand the psychological and cultural origins of your values, distinguishing authentic preferences from unconscious conditioning with philosophical sophistication <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-insight')">i</span>

**Authentic Expression**: Maintain values alignment consistently through major life transitions, crises, and extreme external pressure to compromise <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-authentic')">i</span>

**Values Evolution**: Intentionally cultivate specific values through targeted practices and experiences, with wisdom about when stability versus change serves wellbeing <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-evolution')">i</span>

### Level 5: Mastery (99.9th percentile capability)

**Practical Decision-Making**: Achieve unconscious integration where values naturally guide behaviour without deliberate effort, handling complex moral dilemmas with clear reasoning <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-practical')">i</span>

**Comprehensive Insight**: Demonstrate deep understanding of different ethical frameworks and their applications, with ability to articulate sophisticated values-based reasoning <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-insight')">i</span>

**Authentic Expression**: Achieve natural congruence between inner values and outer behaviour that creates consistency across all life contexts <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-authentic')">i</span>

**Values Evolution**: Exhibit mastery of the balance between values stability and adaptive change, with personal wisdom about values development across lifespan <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-evolution')">i</span>
