# Housework
## Level 2: Fundamentals

This level represents the core fundamentals that deliver maximum benefit for minimal effort - applying the 80/20 principle to home management.

### Benchmarks
- **Cleanliness and Hygiene**: No visible dust on surfaces; floors cleaned regularly; no health hazards present
- **Organisation and Storage**: Daily-use items have consistent locations; major walkways and surfaces free of clutter
- **Home Maintenance**: Basic maintenance schedule exists; critical home systems functioning properly
- **Efficiency**: 3-4 hours weekly maintenance time; essential tools organised and accessible

### Benefits
Achieving this level establishes the foundation for an efficient home. Eliminating clutter can reduce housework by up to 40% ([National Soap and Detergent Association](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/the-cost-of-clutter-in-your-home/)). Physical clutter also competes for attention, reducing focus and increasing stress. Common household health hazards like mold, poor ventilation, and certain cleaning chemical combinations can significantly impact respiratory health and overall wellbeing. By implementing these fundamentals, you'll eliminate the most significant friction points while investing minimal time - this level represents the most efficient starting point for home management.

### Actions (Quick Wins)
- Identify and eliminate common household health hazards such as mold, pest entry points, and tripping hazards using this [CDC Home Assessment Checklist](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/publications/housing_assessment/housing_assessment.htm)

- Declutter visible spaces using the "four-box method" (keep, donate, store, trash) following [this guide from The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/four-box-method-for-decluttering-2648624)
- Learn efficient cleaning techniques for different areas using [Clean My Space's comprehensive cleaning tutorials](https://cleanmyspace.com/cleaning-basics/) (1 hour)
- Set up a simple routine based on [Clean Mama's system](https://cleanmama.com/start-here/), which assigns different cleaning tasks to specific days of the week (Monday: bathroom day, Tuesday: dusting day, etc.)

### Habits
