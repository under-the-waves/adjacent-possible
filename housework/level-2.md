# Housework
## Level 2: Fundamentals

This level represents the core fundamentals that deliver maximum benefit for minimal effort—applying the 80/20 principle to home management.

### Benchmarks
- **Cleanliness and Hygiene**: 
  - No visible dust on surfaces
  - Bathroom and kitchen sanitized weekly
  - Floors vacuumed/mopped weekly
  - No health hazards (mold, pests, unsafe conditions)

- **Organization and Storage**:
  - Daily-use items have consistent, accessible locations
  - Major walkways and surfaces free of clutter
  - Basic sorting system for incoming items (mail, purchases)
  - 80% of items can be located within 1 minute

- **Home Maintenance and Systems**:
  - Basic maintenance schedule exists
  - Critical home systems functioning properly
  - Simple cleaning routines established
  - Emergency contacts documented

- **Time and Resource Efficiency**:
  - 3-4 hours weekly maintenance time
  - Essential tools and supplies organized and accessible
  - Basic labor division for multi-person households
  - Minimal waste of consumable supplies

**Benefits**: Achieving this level establishes the foundation for an efficient home. A study by the National Soap and Detergent Association found that eliminating clutter would reduce housework by 40% ([source](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/the-cost-of-clutter-in-your-home/)). Meanwhile, Princeton University researchers discovered that physical clutter competes for attention, reducing focus and increasing stress ([source](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/2/587)). By implementing these fundamentals, you'll eliminate the most significant friction points while investing minimal time—essentially the "low-hanging fruit" of home management.

### Actions (Quick Wins)
- Declutter visible spaces using the "four-box method" (keep, donate, store, trash) following [this guide from The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/four-box-method-for-decluttering-2648624)
- Create a "command center" for important household information (calendar, contacts, schedules) using [this FlyLady system](https://www.flylady.net/d/getting-started/flying-lessons/control-journal/)
- Establish a simple mail processing system (example: [OHIO method - "Only Handle It Once"](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-ohio-method-for-processing-mail-and-paperwork-245271))
- Implement a daily "reset routine" for main living areas using [Clear & CALM's 10-minute reset](https://clearandcalm.com/home-tidying-routine/)
- Identify and eliminate health hazards using this [CDC Home Assessment Checklist](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/publications/housing_assessment/housing_assessment.htm)
- Set up the basics of the [Clean Mama routine](https://cleanmama.com/start-here/) for consistent maintenance

### Habits
- Implement a 10-minute daily reset routine (quick tidy of main living areas)
- Practice the "one-touch rule" for mail and daily items
- Maintain clear counters and surfaces in kitchen and bathrooms
- Address spills and messes immediately rather than letting them accumulate
- Run one load of dishes and one load of laundry when needed (avoid buildup)
- Perform weekly cleaning of essential areas (bathrooms, kitchen)
- Manage trash and recycling on a consistent schedule
- Put items away immediately after use

### Costs

- **Dishwasher**: If available, saves approximately 230 hours annually compared to hand washing ([source](https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/dishwashers))
  * Run only when full
  * Skip pre-rinsing to save water and time
  * Estimated return: 30 minutes saved weekly

- **Washing Machine/Dryer**:
  * Use concentrated detergents
  * Implement a simple sorting system nearby
  * Fold immediately after drying to prevent wrinkles
