[‚Üê Back to Level 2](level-2)
# Housework
## Level 3: Proficiency
This level represents home management capabilities that exceed 80% of households.

### Benchmarks
- **Cleanliness and Hygiene**: All surfaces regularly dust-free and sanitised; deep cleaning performed on consistent schedule
- **Organisation and Storage**: 90% of items have logical, dedicated storage locations; zoned storage areas with appropriate supplies
- **Home Maintenance**: Preventative maintenance schedule for all home systems; protocols exist for handling common issues
- **Efficiency**: 5 hours weekly maintenance time; streamlined routines for regular tasks

### Benefits
At Level 3, you'll experience tangible improvements in daily life quality. People with organised homes have lower levels of cortisol (stress hormone) throughout the day ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218784894)). The average person spends one year of their life looking for lost items ([National Association of Professional Organizers](https://www.napo.net/)) - a problem largely eliminated at this level. The increased time investment compared to Level 2 is strategic - by implementing preventative systems now, you significantly reduce future time costs and disruptions.

### Actions
