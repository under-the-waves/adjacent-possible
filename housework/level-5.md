[‚Üê Back to Level 5](level-5)
# Housework
## Level 5: Mastery
This level represents what the top 1% achieve with their home management systems.

### Benchmarks
- **Cleanliness and Hygiene**: Professional-grade standards maintained consistently throughout the home
- **Organisation and Storage**: Custom organisation systems optimised for household needs; comprehensive inventory management of possessions
- **Home Maintenance**: Predictive maintenance using sensors and monitoring; proactive solutions before problems manifest
- **Efficiency**: 2-3 hours weekly personal time investment; effective management of service providers

### Benefits
At Level 5, home management becomes highly efficient and personalized. Optimally designed environments measurably improve cognitive function and reduce mental fatigue ([Journal of Environmental Psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494415000328)). Properly managed service delegation can reclaim up to 15-20 hours weekly for busy professionals. Well-designed systems reduce decision fatigue and mental load, allowing you to focus on what matters most.
