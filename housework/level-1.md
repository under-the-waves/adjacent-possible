# Housework
## Level 1: Awareness

This level requires no habit changes or financial investment—just assessment and planning.

### Benchmarks
- **Cleanliness and Hygiene**: 
  - Understand current cleaning practices and standards
  - Identify health-critical areas needing attention
  - Recognize appropriate cleaning methods for different surfaces
  - Assess current cleaning product usage and effectiveness

- **Organization and Storage**:
  - Understand current organization systems (or lack thereof)
  - Identify high-traffic areas and pain points
  - Recognize which items lack proper storage locations
  - Assess current storage capacity and utilization

- **Home Maintenance and Systems**:
  - Document basic home systems requiring maintenance
  - Identify current maintenance schedule (if any)
  - Recognize potential problem areas or upcoming needs
  - Understand basic home maintenance responsibilities

- **Time and Resource Efficiency**:
  - Know how much time is currently spent on housework
  - Understand current expenses related to home maintenance
  - Recognize inefficiencies in current processes
  - Identify personal priorities and values regarding home management

**Benefits**: At this level, you gain crucial self-awareness that eliminates guesswork and establishes direction. Understanding your starting point saves significant time and money by preventing misguided purchases and ineffective strategies. This awareness aligns your efforts with your true priorities, ensuring that future investments deliver maximum personal value. A study in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that simply documenting current practices increases consciousness of habits and creates natural motivation for improvement ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494413000261)), making this planning phase essential for sustainable change.
