# Friendship

## Why Friendship Matters

Friendships serve as one of the most powerful predictors of wellbeing and life satisfaction across the lifespan. Research consistently demonstrates that people with strong social connections live longer, experience better physical and mental health, and show greater resilience during difficult periods <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-health-benefits')">i</span>. Quality friendships provide emotional support that can be more beneficial for cognitive health than family relationships, particularly as we age <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-cognitive-benefits')">i</span>.

Beyond individual benefits, friendships create meaning and purpose through shared experiences, mutual support, and opportunities for personal growth. People who maintain close friendships report higher life satisfaction than those who prioritise marriage, children, or financial success <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-life-satisfaction')">i</span>. The absence of close friendships carries health risks equivalent to smoking or obesity, whilst strong social connections can reduce mortality risk by up to 50%.

## Friendship Values

Your approach to friendship depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances three core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Friends Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/friends/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Depth (45%)
Investing heavily in a smaller number of very close friendships that involve high levels of trust, vulnerability, and mutual understanding. This includes regular meaningful conversations, emotional support during difficult times, sharing personal struggles and dreams, and developing relationships that deepen over many years. People who prioritise this value focus their social energy on cultivating intimate bonds with a select few rather than maintaining many lighter connections.

### Breadth (35%)
Building and maintaining a diverse network of friendships across different contexts, interests, and social circles. This includes workplace friends, hobby-based connections, neighbourhood relationships, and casual social acquaintances who provide variety, opportunities, and a sense of belonging to multiple communities. Those who prioritise this value enjoy meeting new people, participating in group activities, and having friends for different aspects of their lives.

### Growth (20%)
Seeking friendships that challenge you to improve, learn, and develop as a person. This includes friends who offer different perspectives, hold you accountable to your goals, introduce you to new ideas or experiences, and aren't afraid to give honest feedback. People who prioritise this value actively seek relationships that push them outside their comfort zone and contribute to their personal development.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals concerning trends in friendship patterns across the population. The percentage of adults reporting no close friends tripled from 3% in 1990 to 12% in 2021, whilst those claiming 10 or more close friends dropped from 33% to just 13%. Most adults (53%) now have between one and four close friends, with only 38% maintaining five or more. Additionally, emotional support exchange remains limited - only 48% of women and 30% of men share personal feelings with friends weekly. These patterns mean that even modest achievements in friendship development represent higher population percentiles than might initially be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**Depth**: Recognise your current capacity for emotional vulnerability and the level of mutual support in your existing close relationships <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-depth')">i</span>

**Breadth**: Understand your current social network size, the diversity of contexts where you have friends, and gaps in your social ecosystem <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-breadth')">i</span>

**Growth**: Identify how friendships have influenced your personal development and what you seek from these relationships in terms of challenge and learning <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-growth')">i</span>

### Level 2: Foundation (80th percentile capability)

**Depth**: Maintain regular meaningful contact with 2-3 close friends, including sharing personal feelings or challenges at least monthly with at least one friend <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-depth')">i</span>

**Breadth**: Actively maintain friendships across 3-4 different contexts (work, neighbourhood, hobbies, family connections) with total network of 8-12 people you consider friends <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-breadth')">i</span>

**Growth**: Engage in conversations with friends that challenge your perspectives or introduce new ideas at least several times per year <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-growth')">i</span>

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**Depth**: Sustain 3-5 intimate friendships characterised by regular emotional support exchange, with weekly meaningful conversations with at least one close friend and monthly deep conversations with others <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-depth')">i</span>

**Breadth**: Maintain diverse friendship network of 12-20 people across multiple contexts, actively nurturing connections through regular contact and shared activities <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-breadth')">i</span>

**Growth**: Consistently seek and provide honest feedback with close friends, actively pursue new perspectives through friendship connections, and adapt behaviour based on insights gained from these relationships <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-growth')">i</span>

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)

**Depth**: Cultivate relationships with depth that most people never experience - regular vulnerable conversations, reliable emotional support during major life challenges, and friendships that significantly influence major life decisions <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-depth')">i</span>

**Breadth**: Maintain extensive network of 20+ meaningful friendships across varied contexts whilst successfully balancing time and emotional investment across all relationships <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-breadth')">i</span>

**Growth**: Actively seek friendships that consistently challenge comfort zones, maintain relationships with people holding significantly different worldviews, and demonstrate measurable personal growth directly attributable to friendship influences <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-growth')">i</span>

### Level 5: Mastery (99.9th percentile capability)

**Depth**: Achieve friendship intimacy and support exchange that rivals family relationships - daily meaningful contact with closest friends, complete emotional transparency, and friendships that provide primary life direction and major decision guidance <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-depth')">i</span>

**Breadth**: Successfully coordinate complex social ecosystem of 30+ active friendships across multiple life domains whilst maintaining quality connections with each person and facilitating connections between friends <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-breadth')">i</span>

**Growth**: Maintain friendships that consistently transform your perspectives and capabilities, actively seek relationships with people from dramatically different backgrounds or expertise areas, and demonstrate continuous personal evolution directly driven by friendship-based learning and challenge <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-growth')">i</span>
