*"The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself." – Steven Johnson*

We live in a remarkable time for human development. Never before have we had such understanding of what helps us thrive - from the science of sleep to the psychology of relationships. The internet has democratised this knowledge while technology has created countless tools to help us apply it.

But this wealth of information brings its own challenge: how do we choose what's worthwhile? With an endless stream of books, courses, apps and expert advice, it's hard to know what to prioritise.

These guides aim to provide evidence-backed approaches to improving our lives, identifying specific actions and resources that provide the greatest benefits relative to their costs in time, money and energy.

## Core Principles

The Adjacent Possible is built on three foundational principles:

- **Evidence-based interventions** supported by research
- **Focus on low-hanging fruit and the 80/20 rule** to get the highest benefits for your time and money
- **A holistic approach** to personal development, ensuring important areas aren't neglected

## Individual Differences and Values

People have different values, circumstances, and starting points. What works well for one person may not work for another based on personal priorities, available resources and specific life situations. While these guides provide principles that are likely to benefit most people, your mileage may vary. Take only what is useful and adapt it to your own life values.

## The Five-Level Framework

Each guide breaks down progress into five distinct stages, allowing you to identify your current position and plan your next steps:

### Level 1: Awareness
Level 1 requires minimal investment—typically 1 hour of time with no financial cost. It focuses on understanding why this area matters, what's possible to achieve, assessing your current capabilities, and creating a simple improvement plan.

### Level 2: Foundations
Level 2 applies the 80/20 principle—implementing the vital 20% of actions that deliver 80% of results. This typically requires about 5 hours of time and approximately $200 in basic tools or resources, resulting in significant improvement with minimal lifestyle disruption.

### Level 3: Proficiency
Level 3 involves developing systems and habits that put you ahead of most people. This requires moderate time and resources but creates sustainable routines that maintain progress with minimal friction. The outcome is performance roughly in the top 20% of people in this domain.

### Level 4: Excellence
Level 4 represents advanced development that few people achieve. This level often involves detailed tracking and approaches tailored to individual needs and circumstances. It requires significant time and resources but produces capabilities that exceed what most people accomplish, roughly in the top 5%.

### Level 5: Mastery
Level 5 represents comprehensive knowledge and highly developed skills in a domain. While relatively rare, this level is achieved by those who dedicate substantial time and consistent effort to an area. It typically involves extensive knowledge, refined systems, and a deep understanding of the subject matter, putting performance roughly in the top 1%.
