*"The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself." â€“ Steven Johnson*

We live in a remarkable time for human development. Never before have we had such understanding of what helps us thrive - from the science of sleep to the psychology of relationships. The internet has democratised this knowledge while technology has created countless tools to help us apply it.

But this wealth of information brings its own challenge: how do we choose what's worthwhile? With an endless stream of books, courses, apps and expert advice, it's hard to know what to prioritise.

These guides aim to help improve our lives according to three foundational principles:
- **Evidence-based** interventions
- **Using the 80/20 rule** to get the most benefit for your time and money
- **A holistic approach** ensuring important areas aren't neglected
