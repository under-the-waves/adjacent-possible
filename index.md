*"The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself." â€“ Steven Johnson*

We live in a remarkable time for human development. Never before have we had such understanding of what helps us thrive - from the science of sleep to the psychology of relationships. The internet has democratised this knowledge while technology has created countless tools to help us apply it.

But this wealth of information brings its own challenge: how do we choose what's worthwhile? With an endless stream of books, courses, apps and expert advice, it's hard to know what to prioritise.

These guides aim to help improve our lives according to three foundational principles:
- **Evidence-based** interventions
- **Using the 80/20 rule** to get the most benefit for your time and money
- **A holistic approach** ensuring important areas aren't neglected

Each guide follows a [Five-Level Framework]({{ site.baseurl }}/5-levels/), a systematic approach to improvement that helps you identify where you are and what to focus on next. The framework provides a clear progression path from basic awareness to mastery in any area of life.

## Individual Differences and Values

People have different values, circumstances, and starting points. What works well for one person may not work for another based on personal priorities, available resources and specific life situations. While these guides provide principles that are likely to benefit most people, your mileage may vary. Take only what is useful and adapt it to your own life values.

## How to Use These Guides
These guides help you systematically improve different areas of your life by identifying the most cost-effective interventions at your current level. Whether you're looking to ensure you haven't missed any obvious low-cost improvements, find the best resources for your skill level, understand where you stand relative to others, or see what's possible with dedicated effort, each guide provides a clear roadmap. The goal isn't to reach Level 5 in every area - simply achieving Level 2 across most domains would be a worthwhile goal, as it would indicate you're taking advantage of all the "low-hanging fruit" while not neglecting important aspects of your life.
