*"The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself." – Steven Johnson*

Welcome! This website provides a structured approach to personal development across various life domains. It focuses on identifying and implementing the highest-value improvements to your live for your time, energy, and resources. Each level builds upon the previous one, making new capabilities accessible as foundational skills are established. 

## Core Principles

The Adjacent Possible is built on three foundational principles:

- **Evidence-based interventions** supported by research
- **Focus on low-hanging fruit and the 80/20 rule** to get the highest benefits for your time and money
- **A holistic approach** to personal development, ensuring important areas aren't neglected

## The Five-Level Framework

Each guide breaks down progress into five distinct stages, allowing you to identify your current position and plan your next steps:

### Level 1: Awareness
Level 1 requires minimal investment—typically 1 hour of time with no financial cost. It focuses on understanding why this area matters, what's possible to achieve, assessing your current capabilities, and creating a simple improvement plan.

### Level 2: Foundations
Level 2 applies the 80/20 principle—implementing the vital 20% of actions that deliver 80% of results. This typically requires about 5 hours of time and approximately $200 in basic tools or resources, resulting in significant improvement with minimal lifestyle disruption.

### Level 3: Proficiency
Level 3 involves developing systems and habits that put you ahead of most people. This requires moderate time and resources but creates sustainable routines that maintain progress with minimal friction. The outcome is performance roughly in the top 20% of people in this domain.

### Level 4: Excellence
Level 4 represents advanced development that few people achieve. This level often involves detailed tracking and approaches tailored to individual needs and circumstances. It requires significant time and resources but produces capabilities that exceed what most people accomplish, roughly in the top 5%.

### Level 5: Mastery
Level 5 represents comprehensive knowledge and highly developed skills in a domain. While relatively rare, this level is achieved by those who dedicate substantial time and consistent effort to an area. It typically involves extensive knowledge, refined systems, and a deep understanding of the subject matter, putting performance roughly in the top 1%.

## Individual Differences and Values

People have different values, circumstances, and starting points. What works well for one person may not work for another based on individual biology, personal priorities, available resources, and specific life situations. The guides provide principles that benefit most people while acknowledging these differences, focusing on approaches that can be adapted to individual circumstances.

## Strategic Choices

While one could pursue improvement in every life area, thoughtful living means making intentional choices about which domains deserve focus. This might involve identifying current bottlenecks, considering personal values, recognizing areas with potential positive spillover effects, and evaluating where time and effort would create the most meaningful change.
