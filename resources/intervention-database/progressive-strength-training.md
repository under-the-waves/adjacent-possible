# Progressive Strength Training

Systematic weightlifting program with progressive overload, training major muscle groups 3 times per week to build strength, muscle mass, and metabolic health.

## Value Scoring Framework

### Health & Longevity
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Interventions extending healthy lifespan by 10+ years (e.g., smoking cessation for heavy smokers)
- **+5:** Moderate longevity benefits reducing disease risk by ~15% (e.g., regular walking program)
- **-5:** Moderate health risks increasing injury/disease probability (e.g., chronic overtraining)
- **-10:** Severe health consequences with major disease risk (e.g., anabolic steroid abuse)

**Potential Benefit Score: +8.5** - Meta-analyses show 20-35% reduction in all-cause mortality from regular resistance training

**Expected Benefit Score: +8.2** - Accounting for 80% adherence rate among beginners who start structured programs

### Performance
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Achieving elite athletic capabilities (e.g., powerlifting competition standards, Olympic lifting technique)
- **+5:** Solid recreational fitness enabling most physical activities (e.g., hiking, sports participation)
- **-5:** Performance decrements from poor programming (e.g., excessive fatigue, strength losses)
- **-10:** Severe performance impairment (e.g., chronic injury preventing physical activity)

**Potential Benefit Score: +9.0** - Beginners typically achieve 40-100% strength increases in major lifts within 6 months

**Expected Benefit Score: +8.7** - Accounting for 80% adherence and realistic progression rates in gym environments

### Appearance
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Dramatic physique transformation (e.g., 20+ kg fat loss with significant muscle gain)
- **+5:** Noticeable body composition improvements visible to others (e.g., 5-10% body fat reduction)
- **-5:** Appearance setbacks from poor execution (e.g., bulk without muscle definition)
- **-10:** Severe negative changes (e.g., major weight gain, muscle wasting from overtraining)

**Potential Benefit Score: +7.5** - Significant muscle hypertrophy (10-25% size increases) and improved body composition achievable

**Expected Benefit Score: +7.2** - Accounting for 80% adherence and realistic muscle building rates for recreational trainees

### Enjoyment
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Activity becomes primary source of physical and mental satisfaction, central to identity
- **+5:** Generally enjoyable activity you look forward to most of the time
- **-5:** Unenjoyable but tolerable activity creating stress or reluctance
- **-10:** Deeply unpleasant activity causing significant psychological distress

**Potential Benefit Score: +6.0** - High long-term satisfaction from visible progress and strength gains once established

**Expected Benefit Score: +5.7** - Accounting for initial learning curve intimidation and 80% who continue past 3 months

## Resource Requirements

**Upfront Cost: $400** - Gym membership ($200/year) plus basic equipment (shoes, belt, straps) or minimal home setup

**Ongoing Cost: $12/week** - Average gym membership cost factoring in annual/multi-year discounts

**Upfront Time Investment: 8 hours** - Learning basic movement patterns, gym familiarisation, and initial program setup

**Ongoing Time Investment: 4.5 hours/week** - Three 90-minute sessions including warm-up, workout, and minimal travel time

## Prerequisites

- Can perform 10 bodyweight squats and 5 push-ups with proper form
- No untreated joint injuries or cardiovascular conditions requiring medical clearance
- Access to gym with barbells/weight plates or home equipment budget of $300-800
- Can consistently commit 4.5 hours per week for at least 3 months
- Willing to spend 2-4 weeks learning proper form before adding significant weight
- Basic understanding that strength training requires progressive overload and patience
