# The Five-Level Framework

The Adjacent Possible guides break down progress into five distinct stages, allowing you to identify your current position and plan your next steps in any area of life.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: Awareness

This level involves assessment and understanding only. It requires no habit changes or financial investment – just evaluation of your current situation and planning for improvement.

### Level 2: Foundations

This level represents what the top 20% of the general population achieve in this life area. The effort required varies significantly by life area – some foundations can be built quickly, others require sustained commitment over months or years.

### Level 3: Proficiency

This level represents what the top 5% of the general population achieve in this life area. This level represents what most dedicated individuals can achieve with focused effort and good systems.

### Level 4: Excellence

This level represents what the top 1% of the general population achieve in this life area. This can sometimes requires specialised knowledge, advanced techniques, and more time investment.

### Level 5: Mastery

This level represents what the top 0.1% of people achieve in this life area. You've achieved mastery that represents truly exceptional capability in this domain.

## How to Use This Framework

Each life area guide follows this consistent structure, allowing you to:

1. **Identify your current level** based on the benchmarks provided
2. **Focus on the next logical steps** rather than becoming overwhelmed by possibilities
3. **Make informed decisions** about how to allocate limited time and resources
4. **Recognise your progress** as you advance through the levels

Remember that these levels represent a general progression. Your personal path may include elements from multiple levels simultaneously, or you may choose to optimise certain areas while maintaining others at a more basic level based on your priorities.
