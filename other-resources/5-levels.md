# The Five-Level Framework

The Adjacent Possible guides break down progress into five distinct stages, allowing you to identify your current position and plan your next steps in any area of life.

## The Five Levels

### Level 1: Awareness

Level 1 requires minimal investment—typically 1 hour of time with no financial cost. It focuses on:

- Understanding why this life area is important
- Learning what's possible to achieve
- Assessing your current capabilities
- Creating a simple improvement plan

This phase creates clarity without requiring immediate habit changes, giving you direction before you invest significant time or resources.

### Level 2: Foundations

This level represents what the top 20% of the general population achieve in this life area. At this level, you've established solid fundamentals that put you ahead of most people. The effort required varies significantly by life area – some foundations can be built quickly, others require sustained commitment over months or years.

### Level 3: Proficiency

This level represents what the top 5% of the general population achieve in this life area. You've developed genuine proficiency that exceeds the vast majority of people. This level represents what most dedicated individuals can achieve with focused effort and good systems.

### Level 4: Excellence

This level represents what the top 1% of the general population achieve in this life area. This can sometimes requires specialised knowledge, advanced techniques, and more time investment.

### Level 5: Mastery

This level represents what the top 0.1% of people achieve in this life area. You've achieved mastery that represents truly exceptional capability in this domain.

## How to Use This Framework

Each life area guide follows this consistent structure, allowing you to:

1. **Identify your current level** based on the benchmarks provided
2. **Focus on the next logical steps** rather than becoming overwhelmed by possibilities
3. **Make informed decisions** about how to allocate limited time and resources
4. **Recognise your progress** as you advance through the levels

Remember that these levels represent a general progression. Your personal path may include elements from multiple levels simultaneously, or you may choose to optimise certain areas while maintaining others at a more basic level based on your priorities.
