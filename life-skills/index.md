# Life Skills Values and Benchmarks Framework

## What is Life Skills?

Life skills encompasses the practical capabilities needed to handle everyday challenges and maintain independence in modern life. This covers essential competencies like basic home maintenance, car care, financial tasks, cooking, first aid, and technology troubleshooting. The domain ranges from fundamental survival skills that every adult should possess to advanced craftsmanship and systematic approaches to practical problem-solving.

## Why Life Skills Matter

Practical competence serves as a foundation for adult independence and confidence. Research shows that people with diverse practical skills report higher levels of self-efficacy and life satisfaction, while also achieving measurable financial benefits through reduced reliance on professional services <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('financial-benefits')">i</span>. The psychological impact extends beyond immediate utility – mastering practical skills creates a sense of capability that transfers to other life domains <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('psychological-benefits')">i</span>, whilst building practical knowledge often strengthens social connections through helping others and participating in community activities <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('social-benefits')">i</span>.

## Life Skills Values

Your optimal approach to life skills depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances three core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Life Skills Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/life-skills/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### High-Impact Capabilities (45%)

Focusing on learning specific skills that provide disproportionate benefits when needed – the handful of practical abilities that save significant money, prevent major problems, or handle important situations. This includes skills like first aid, basic car maintenance, essential home repairs, and core cooking techniques. People who prioritise this value want to master the specific capabilities that matter most, rather than trying to learn everything.

### Systematic Competence (35%)

Building organised, methodical approaches to practical knowledge and maintenance rather than learning skills reactively as problems arise. This includes creating reference systems, following preventive schedules, maintaining proper tools, and developing frameworks for tackling unfamiliar tasks. Those who prioritise this value want structured, reliable approaches to practical life management.

### Teaching & Sharing (20%)

Using practical skills as opportunities to help others, connect with family and friends, or contribute to community. This includes teaching skills to children, helping neighbours with projects, being the person others turn to for practical advice, or participating in skill-sharing activities. Those who prioritise this value see life skills as ways to build relationships and contribute meaningfully to others' lives.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that practical skill competence varies dramatically across populations. Studies indicate that only about 36% of adults feel confident in their car maintenance abilities <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('car-maintenance-stats')">i</span>, while surveys show that 38% of Americans cannot perform any basic home repairs <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('home-repair-stats')">i</span>. Regarding sewing skills, UK research found that 74% of adults could sew on a button, but only 47% could mend a hole or adjust a hem <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('sewing-stats')">i</span>. The American Red Cross reports that while millions receive first aid training, only about 40% of adults have completed or are interested in taking lifesaving courses <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('first-aid-stats')">i</span>. These patterns mean that even modest practical achievements represent higher population percentiles than might initially be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**High-Impact Capabilities**: Identify 5-10 practical skills that would provide significant benefit in your specific life situation and assess current competence in each area.

**Systematic Competence**: Understand your current approach to handling practical problems and recognize patterns in how you typically respond to household, automotive, or personal maintenance needs.

**Teaching & Sharing**: Recognize opportunities where practical skills could strengthen relationships with family, friends, or community members and identify what you might want to learn or share.

### Level 2: Foundation (80th percentile capability)

**High-Impact Capabilities**: Successfully perform 4-5 essential skills such as changing a car tyre, basic first aid/CPR, cooking meals from scratch, simple sewing repairs (sewing on buttons, mending small tears), unclogging drains, and basic computer troubleshooting. Complete own tax returns or handle equivalent financial paperwork without professional assistance.

**Systematic Competence**: Maintain organized toolbox with essential tools, follow basic car maintenance schedule, and keep accessible reference materials for common household tasks. Approach problems systematically rather than randomly attempting solutions.

**Teaching & Sharing**: Successfully help family members or friends with practical tasks and share knowledge in areas where you have developed competence. Serve as a reliable resource for basic practical problems within your immediate circle.

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**High-Impact Capabilities**: Demonstrate competence in 8-10 practical skills including basic plumbing repairs (fixing leaks, replacing faucets), simple electrical work (replacing outlets, installing ceiling fans), interior painting to good standards, intermediate cooking techniques, and advanced computer/technology troubleshooting. Handle most routine practical problems without professional assistance.

**Systematic Competence**: Implement comprehensive home maintenance schedules, maintain professional-quality tool organization, and consistently apply systematic approaches to new practical challenges. Prevent most problems through proactive maintenance rather than reactive repairs.

**Teaching & Sharing**: Regularly help others develop practical skills, serve as a go-to resource for practical problems in your social network, and participate in community skill-sharing activities or informal mentoring relationships.

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)

**High-Impact Capabilities**: Master advanced skills such as building furniture or woodworking projects, complex home repairs, automotive maintenance beyond basics, and demonstrate professional-level competence in 2-3 specialized practical domains. Successfully diagnose and resolve complex, multi-faceted problems.

**Systematic Competence**: Maintain sophisticated systems for practical knowledge management, implement comprehensive preventive approaches that prevent most problems before they occur, and consistently apply professional-level problem-solving methods across all practical domains.

**Teaching & Sharing**: Mentor others systematically in practical skill development, contribute meaningfully to community resilience through your capabilities, and regularly expand others' practical competence through formal or informal teaching.

### Level 5: Mastery (99.9th percentile capability)

**High-Impact Capabilities**: Complete major projects like installing flooring, building decks, or significant home renovations while maintaining broad competence across most practical domains relevant to daily life. Achieve near-professional competence in chosen practical domains while handling complex, multi-faceted problems across all areas.

**Systematic Competence**: Develop and refine comprehensive systems that others adopt, demonstrate exceptional efficiency in practical problem-solving, and maintain professional-level organization and preventive approaches across all practical domains. Serve as a model of systematic practical competence.

**Teaching & Sharing**: Significantly enhance others' practical capabilities through systematic knowledge transfer, contribute to community education or preparedness initiatives, and create lasting improvements in practical competence within your sphere of influence. Develop others who themselves become skilled practitioners.
