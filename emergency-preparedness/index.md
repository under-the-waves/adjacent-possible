# Emergency Preparedness

## What is Emergency Preparedness?

Emergency preparedness encompasses systematic planning and resource allocation to maintain resilience during disruptions – from power outages and severe weather to economic shocks or health crises. This covers physical supplies (food, water, first aid), knowledge and skills (basic medical training, communication protocols), planning (evacuation routes, family coordination), and community connections (neighbourhood networks, mutual aid). It spans immediate response capability through longer-term adaptation to changed circumstances, addressing both likely regional risks and rare but potentially catastrophic scenarios.

## Why Emergency Preparedness Matters

Emergency preparedness serves as a foundation for maintaining safety and quality of life when normal systems fail. Research consistently demonstrates that household preparedness significantly improves outcomes during disasters <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-key-1')">i</span>, whilst community-level preparedness creates multiplying effects that benefit entire neighbourhoods <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-key-2')">i</span>. Studies show that prepared households experience less financial strain, psychological distress, and physical harm during emergencies <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-key-3')">i</span>.

Beyond individual benefits, emergency preparedness builds resilience that extends throughout communities and reduces strain on emergency services during large-scale events. The skills, relationships, and resources developed through preparedness activities provide value during everyday challenges as well as major crises.

## Emergency Preparedness Values

Your optimal approach to emergency preparedness depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Emergency Preparedness Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/emergency-preparedness/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Self-Reliance (25%)
Building personal and family capability to handle emergencies independently without requiring external assistance. This includes maintaining adequate supplies, developing essential skills, and creating systems that allow you to sustain your household during disruptions. People who prioritise this value focus on stockpiling resources, learning practical skills like first aid and basic repairs, and ensuring their family can function autonomously when normal support systems fail.

### Community Resilience (25%)
Developing collective preparedness through social networks, mutual aid, and coordinated community response capabilities. This emphasises building relationships with neighbours, participating in local emergency response groups, sharing resources and knowledge, and creating systems for collective support during crises. Those who prioritise this value focus on strengthening social bonds, organising neighbourhood preparedness efforts, and building trust networks that can mobilise quickly during emergencies.

### Baseline Resilience (30%)
Focusing preparation efforts on probable, manageable disruptions that occur within stable social systems. This includes preparing for regional natural disasters (bushfires, floods, severe storms), infrastructure failures (power outages, water disruptions), economic downturns affecting your area, temporary supply chain interruptions, and health emergencies requiring isolation. People who prioritise this value concentrate on realistic scenarios they're likely to face, ensuring solid preparation for events that happen regularly in their region whilst maintaining normal life circumstances.

### Catastrophic Resilience (20%)
Focusing preparation efforts on rare but potentially civilization-altering scenarios that could fundamentally disrupt society. This includes preparing for global pandemics, economic collapse, technological failures affecting critical infrastructure, supply chain breakdown, social unrest, climate-related mass displacement, or existential risks from emerging technologies. Those who prioritise this value invest significant resources in scenarios that might require extended self-sufficiency, fundamental lifestyle changes, or adaptation to entirely new social conditions.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that most Americans have limited emergency preparedness engagement, with approximately 50% lacking basic household emergency plans and nearly half having no emergency supply kits. Community preparedness participation rates are particularly low, with most neighbourhood networks having minimal active participation. These patterns mean that even modest preparedness achievements represent higher population percentiles than might initially be expected.
