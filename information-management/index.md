# Information Management

## What is Information Management?

Information Management encompasses building systems to capture, organize, synthesize, and retrieve information to support better thinking and decision-making. This includes knowledge from books, articles, conversations, and experiences, as well as the meta-skills for organizing any type of information effectively.

While specific document workflows (tax filing, health records, warranties) are covered in their respective life areas, Information Management provides the foundational organizational principles and retrieval capabilities that make you efficient at finding any information across all domains.

## Why Information Management Matters

Information Management serves as a foundation for effective thinking and decision-making in an increasingly complex world. Research shows that knowledge workers spend 15-30% of their time searching for information <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('search-time-research')">i</span>, whilst most people lose 70-80% of valuable insights from books and articles within weeks of encountering them <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('retention-research')">i</span>.

Beyond individual productivity, systematic information management enables the kind of cross-domain thinking that drives innovation and insight <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('innovation-research')">i</span>. The ability to capture, retain, and synthesize information across different contexts becomes increasingly valuable as the pace of information creation accelerates and decision-making becomes more complex.

## Information Management Values

Your optimal approach to information management depends on what aspects you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Information Management Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/information-management/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Information Retention (35%)
Capturing and preserving valuable insights, ideas, and knowledge from various sources without losing them over time. This inherently involves comprehensive coverage - the more you retain, the more valuable your knowledge base becomes. People who prioritise this value focus on broad capture across many sources and contexts.

### Retrieval Efficiency (30%)
Finding the right information quickly when you need it. This inherently serves practical application - having relevant knowledge accessible at decision points is what makes information management valuable for real-world outcomes. People who prioritise this value focus on search capabilities, organisation schemes, and fast access.

### Insight Generation (20%)
Connecting ideas across sources to generate new understanding, identify patterns, and develop original thinking. People who prioritise this value focus on systems that help them see relationships between concepts and build coherent mental models.

### System Simplicity (15%)
Preferring approaches that minimise ongoing cognitive overhead and maintenance burden, whether through minimal analogue systems (notebooks, index cards) or highly automated digital setups. People who prioritise this value want their information system to support their thinking without becoming a project unto itself.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that most people have extremely limited systematic information management capabilities, with studies suggesting fewer than 15% maintain any structured approach beyond basic note-taking <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('adoption-research')">i</span>. Common barriers include system complexity, unclear benefits, and maintenance overhead <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('barriers-research')">i</span>. These patterns mean that even modest systematic approaches represent higher population percentiles than might initially be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**Information Retention**: Understand what information you currently capture and lose; recognise which sources provide valuable insights; identify gaps in your coverage across different contexts and sources <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-retention')">i</span>

**Retrieval Efficiency**: Understand how much time you spend searching for any type of information; recognise which types of information are most difficult to locate when needed; identify current gaps between information needs and access speed across all life areas <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-retrieval')">i</span>

**Insight Generation**: Recognise when you generate new insights by connecting information; understand which information sources and formats best support your thinking; identify missed opportunities for knowledge synthesis <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-insight')">i</span>

**System Simplicity**: Understand your preferences for information management complexity; recognise the trade-offs between system sophistication and maintenance burden; identify what level of structure feels natural and sustainable <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-simplicity')">i</span>

### Level 2: Foundation (80th percentile capability)

**Retrieval Efficiency**: Have basic methods for organising information across different contexts; can usually find important items (notes, documents, files) within 5-10 minutes when needed; occasionally apply previously captured insights to current decisions and problems <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-retrieval')">i</span>

**Insight Generation**: Occasionally generate new understanding by connecting ideas from different sources; document insights rather than losing them to memory; notice when current situations relate to previously encountered information <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-insight')">i</span>

**System Simplicity**: Maintain an information approach for several months without abandoning it; achieve useful results with minimal daily overhead; choose methods that match your natural working style <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-simplicity')">i</span>

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**Information Retention**: Systematically capture information across multiple sources and contexts; maintain comprehensive coverage of your reading, conversations, and experiences; sustain information capture systems consistently for over a year without abandoning them <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-retention')">i</span>

**Retrieval Efficiency**: Find most information within a few minutes, whether knowledge insights or practical documents; maintain organisation systems that consistently deliver relevant results across multiple life areas; regularly apply captured insights to improve decision-making and problem-solving <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-retrieval')">i</span>

**Insight Generation**: Regularly develop original thinking through connecting information from multiple sources; build mental models that integrate insights across different domains; generate actionable insights that improve decision-making <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-insight')">i</span>

**System Simplicity**: Sustain effective information systems for multiple years; minimise maintenance while maximising benefit; adapt systems to changing needs without complete overhauls <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-simplicity')">i</span>

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)
