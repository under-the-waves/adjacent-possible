## Value Scoring Framework

### Health & Longevity
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Interventions extending healthy lifespan by 10+ years (e.g., smoking cessation for heavy smokers)
- **+5:** Moderate longevity benefits reducing disease risk by ~15% (e.g., regular walking program)
- **-5:** Moderate health risks increasing injury/disease probability (e.g., chronic overtraining)
- **-10:** Severe health consequences with major disease risk (e.g., anabolic steroid abuse)

### Performance
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Achieving elite athletic capabilities (e.g., powerlifting competition standards, Olympic lifting technique)
- **+5:** Solid recreational fitness enabling most physical activities (e.g., hiking, sports participation)
- **-5:** Performance decrements from poor programming (e.g., excessive fatigue, strength losses)
- **-10:** Severe performance impairment (e.g., chronic injury preventing physical activity)

### Appearance
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Dramatic physique transformation (e.g., 20+ kg fat loss with significant muscle gain)
- **+5:** Noticeable body composition improvements visible to others (e.g., 5-10% body fat reduction)
- **-5:** Appearance setbacks from poor execution (e.g., bulk without muscle definition)
- **-10:** Severe negative changes (e.g., major weight gain, muscle wasting from overtraining)

### Enjoyment
**Scale anchors:**
- **+10:** Activity becomes primary source of physical and mental satisfaction, central to identity
- **+5:** Generally enjoyable activity you look forward to most of the time
- **-5:** Unenjoyable but tolerable activity creating stress or reluctance
- **-10:** Deeply unpleasant activity causing significant psychological distress
