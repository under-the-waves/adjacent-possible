## Level 2: Foundations

This level represents the "minimum effective dose" for significant health benefits—the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of results.

### Benchmarks
- Cardiovascular: Complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly; sustain 30 minutes of continuous activity; resting heart rate below 70 bpm
- Strength: Perform 10 proper push-ups; hold a 30-second plank; complete 10 bodyweight squats with proper form
- Flexibility: Touch toes with straight legs; achieve full overhead arm extension without back arch
- Body Composition: Achieve/maintain BMI between 18.5-29.9 or healthy body fat percentage
- Balance: Stand on one leg for 30+ seconds; perform basic movements with stability

**Benefits**: These benchmarks represent the scientific "minimum effective dose" for health and functional benefits. Achieving this level reduces all-cause mortality risk by 30-40%, improves cognitive function by up to 20%, reduces anxiety and depression risk by 20-30%, and provides the baseline fitness needed for daily activities without limitation. You'll have noticeably more energy, better sleep quality, and improved stress management capabilities—all with just 3-5 hours of weekly activity.
