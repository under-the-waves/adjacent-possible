## Level 2: Foundations
This level represents the "minimum effective dose" for significant health benefits – the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of results.

### Benchmarks
- **Cardiovascular**: Complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly; sustain 30 minutes of continuous activity; resting heart rate below 70 bpm
- **Strength**: Perform 10 proper push-ups; hold a 30-second plank; complete 10 bodyweight squats with proper form
- **Flexibility**: Touch toes with straight legs; achieve full overhead arm extension without back arch
- **Consistency**: Maintain regular activity 3-4 days per week with basic recovery practices

### Benefits
These benchmarks represent the scientific "minimum effective dose" for health benefits. Achieving this level reduces all-cause mortality risk by 30-40%, improves cognitive function by up to 20%, reduces anxiety and depression risk by 20-30%, and provides the baseline fitness needed for daily activities without limitation. You'll have noticeably more energy, better sleep quality, and improved stress management capabilities.
