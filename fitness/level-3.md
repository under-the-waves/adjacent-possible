## Level 3: Profiency
This level represents fitness capabilities that exceed 80% of the general population.

### Benchmarks
- **Cardiovascular**: Run 2.4km in under 12 minutes (men) or 14 minutes (women); resting heart rate below 60 bpm; heart rate recovery of 20+ beats within one minute after exertion
- **Strength**: Deadlift 1.5x bodyweight (men) or 1.2x bodyweight (women); perform 20+ push-ups and 5+ pull-ups (men) or 2+ pull-ups (women) with proper form
- **Body Composition**: Achieve visible muscle definition with healthy body fat levels (14-17% for men, 21-24% for women)
- **Movement Quality**: Maintain excellent form in all major compound movements under load; demonstrate good mobility in all major joints

### Benefits
At this level, your fitness provides tangible performance improvements and health protection. You'll experience consistently higher energy levels throughout the day, quick recovery from physical exertion, and the capability to handle unexpected physical demands with ease. This level of fitness correlates with 50-60% lower risk of chronic disease, 30% better cognitive performance during ageing, and significantly better stress resilience and hormone regulation.

### Actions
- Complete a proper fitness assessment with a qualified professional to identify imbalances and areas for improvement
- Learn intermediate programming principles through resources like [Stronger by Science](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/programming/) or [Renaissance Periodization](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/)
- Develop a more personalised training plan based on your specific goals and assessment results
- Establish regular benchmark testing (every 2-3 months) to track progress using the [EXRX Testing Standards](https://exrx.net/Testing)
- Identify limiting factors in your fitness and address them with targeted exercises and mobility work

### Habits
- Train 4-5 days per week with structured programming using proven programs like [GZCLP](https://saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/), [nSuns](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/), or [5/3/1](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner)
- Include both steady-state and interval training for cardiovascular work
- Train each major muscle group 2-3 times per week
- Incorporate unilateral (single-limb) training in routine for balance and symmetry
- Implement scheduled deload weeks every 8-12 weeks to prevent overtraining
- Practice deliberate recovery techniques (foam rolling, mobility work) using resources like [MobilityWOD](https://www.mobilitywod.com/)
- Maintain sleep and nutrition quality with at least 7 hours of sleep and adequate protein intake (1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight)

### Costs
- **Time**: 5-7 hours weekly (3-4 hours strength training, 2-3 hours cardio, 1 hour mobility/recovery)
- **Money**: $500-1000 annually
  - Gym membership: $300-600/year
  - Improved equipment: $100-300
  - Possible occasional coaching: $100-300
  - Specialised recovery tools: $50-100
- **Tools**:
  - Fitness apps: [JeFit](https://www.jefit.com/), [Strong](https://www.strong.app/), [TrainingPeaks](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/)
  - Heart rate monitor or fitness tracker
  - Foam roller, resistance bands, mobility tools
  - Quality lifting shoes or sport-specific footwear
