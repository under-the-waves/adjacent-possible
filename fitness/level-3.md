### Benchmarks
- Cardiovascular:
  - Run 2.4km in under 12 minutes (men) or 14 minutes (women)
  - Resting heart rate below 60 bpm
  - Heart rate recovery of 20+ beats within one minute after exertion
- Strength:
  - Men: Deadlift 1.5x bodyweight, bench press 1x bodyweight, squat 1.25x bodyweight
  - Women: Deadlift 1.2x bodyweight, bench press 0.7x bodyweight, squat 1x bodyweight
  - Perform 20+ push-ups with proper form

  - Men: Body fat 14-17%
  - Women: Body fat 21-24%
  - Visible muscle definition
- Movement Quality:
  - Good mobility in all major joints
  - Able to perform compound movements with excellent form under load

**Benefits**: At this level, your fitness becomes a significant asset rather than just health insurance. You'll have energy reserves that allow sustained high performance in other life areas. Physical tasks rarely limit you, and you recover quickly from exertion. Research shows this level of fitness correlates with 50-60% lower risk of chronic disease, 30% better cognitive performance during aging, and significantly better stress resilience and hormone regulation. Your body now functions more efficiently in nearly every measurable way, and you've established a fitness foundation that can be maintained with reasonable effort for decades.

### Actions
- Complete a proper fitness assessment with a qualified professional
- Learn intermediate programming principles (periodization basics)
