## Level 1: Awareness and Basic Planning

This level requires no habit changes or financial investment – just a one-time assessment and plan development.

### Benchmarks
- **Physical Capacity**: Understand your current cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility levels
- **Body Composition**: Have a baseline understanding of your current status and goals
- **Movement Quality**: Recognise your stability, mobility, and coordination capabilities
- **Recovery and Energy**: Assess your current recovery patterns and energy levels throughout the day

### Benefits
At this level, you gain self-awareness and direction – the essential foundations for any fitness journey. Understanding your starting point eliminates guesswork, prevents injury from attempting inappropriate activities, and allows you to set realistic goals. This awareness correlates with a 60% higher likelihood of maintaining consistent physical activity according to behaviour change research.

### Actions (One-Time Tasks)
- Complete these simple self-assessments (30 minutes total):
  - Cardiovascular: How far can you walk/run without stopping? Do stairs wind you? (5 minutes)
  - Strength: How many push-ups and squats can you do? Can you hang from a bar? (10 minutes)
  - Flexibility: Can you touch your toes? Raise arms overhead without arching back? (5 minutes)
  - Balance: Can you stand on one foot for 30 seconds? (2 minutes)
  - Take basic measurements (weight, rough body composition estimate) (5 minutes)
  - Check resting heart rate (using phone app or manual pulse check) (3 minutes)
- Identify 2-3 physical activities you genuinely enjoy (5 minutes)
- Set 1-2 specific, measurable fitness goals based on assessment results (10 minutes)
- Research local fitness resources (parks, community centres, gyms) (15 minutes)

### Habits
- No new habits required at this level – just awareness and planning
- Continue any current physical activity

### Costs
- **Time**: 1 hour (one-time investment for assessment and planning)
- **Money**: $0
- **Tools**: Free apps like [Google Fit](https://www.google.com/fit/), [Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/), or [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com) for basic tracking
