## Level 1: Awareness and Basic Planning

This level requires no habit changes or financial investment—just a one-time assessment and plan development.

### Benchmarks
- Cardiovascular: Understand your current endurance level
- Strength: Know your basic strength capabilities
- Flexibility: Assess your current range of motion
- Body composition: Have a rough estimate of your current status
- Balance: Recognize your stability capabilities

**Benefits**: At this level, you gain self-awareness and direction—the essential foundations for any fitness journey. Understanding your starting point eliminates guesswork, prevents injury from attempting inappropriate activities, and allows you to set realistic goals. This awareness alone correlates with a 60% higher likelihood of maintaining consistent physical activity according to behavior change research.

### Actions (One-Time Tasks)
- Complete these simple self-assessments:
  - Cardiovascular: How far can you walk/run without stopping? Do stairs wind you?
  - Strength: How many push-ups, squats can you do? Can you hang from a bar?
  - Flexibility: Can you touch your toes? Raise arms overhead without arching back?
  - Balance: Can you stand on one foot for 30 seconds?
- Take basic measurements (weight, rough body composition estimate)
- Check resting heart rate (using phone app like "Instant Heart Rate" or manual pulse check)
- Complete one online fitness assessment (MET-calculator.com or similar)
- Identify 2-3 physical activities you genuinely enjoy
- Set 1-2 specific, measurable fitness goals based on assessment results
- Research local fitness resources (parks, community centers, etc.)
- Identify potential obstacles to regular exercise

### Habits
- No new habits required at this level—just awareness and planning
- Continue any current physical activity

### Costs
- Time: 1-2 hours (one-time investment for assessment and planning)
- Money: $0
- Tools: Free apps like Google Fit, Apple Health, or MyFitnessPal for basic tracking
