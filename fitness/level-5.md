## Level 5: Mastery
This level represents the pinnacle of fitness achievement, comparable to competitive athletes.

### Benchmarks
- **Cardiovascular**: Run 2.4km in under 8:00 (men) or 9:30 (women); VO2 max approaching elite athlete status (55-60+ ml/kg/min for men, 50-55+ ml/kg/min for women)
- **Strength**: Deadlift 2.5x bodyweight (men) or 2.25x bodyweight (women); perform 50+ push-ups and 20+ strict pull-ups (men) or 15+ strict pull-ups (women)
- **Performance**: Complete marathon under 3:00 (men) or 3:30 (women) or competitive level in chosen discipline; execute technical movements with precision under extreme fatigue
- **Body Composition**: Maintain 6-9% body fat (men) or 13-16% body fat (women) with significant muscle development

### Benefits
This level represents the outer limits of human physical capacity. Your body functions as a finely-tuned instrument capable of extraordinary feats. The physiological adaptations at this level include optimised mitochondrial density, exceptional neural efficiency, elite cardiovascular capacity, and remarkable resistance to fatigue. While this level requires significant lifestyle prioritisation, it creates a profound sense of physical mastery.
