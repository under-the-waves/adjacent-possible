## Why Fitness Matters

Fitness serves as a cornerstone of overall wellbeing, influencing virtually every aspect of daily life. Regular physical activity [strengthens your cardiovascular system](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-secret-to-better-health-exercise) and builds muscle and bone density, while simultaneously [improving memory, concentration, and creative thinking](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/3/154). The neurochemical changes from exercise [effectively combat depression and anxiety](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689), creating cascading benefits in mood, relationships, and life satisfaction.

Fitness also transforms physical appearance and boosts confidence, whilst [extending both lifespan and "healthspan"](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61031-9/fulltext)—the period of life spent in good health. These combined benefits make fitness one of the highest-leverage investments you can make in your quality of life.

## Fitness values
There's no one-size-fits-all approach to fitness. Your optimal path depends on which aspects of fitness you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

This guide also focuses on five core components: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and mobility, body composition, and balance and coordination.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Fitness Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/fitness/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Health & Longevity (35%)
Fitness that supports long-term wellbeing and disease prevention. This includes cardiovascular health, maintaining muscle mass for healthy aging, joint integrity, and metabolic health. People who prioritise this value focus on sustainable practices that provide health benefits with minimal injury risk.

### Physical Performance (30%)
Developing functional capabilities such as strength, endurance, power, speed, coordination, and specific skills. This value emphasises what your body can do rather than how it looks. Those who prioritise performance may focus on sport-specific training, measurable improvements in capacity, or achieving particular physical feats.

### Appearance (20%)
Physical aesthetics including muscle definition, body composition, and overall physique. While appearance changes often accompany health and performance improvements, some training approaches specifically optimise for visual results. Those who prioritise this value may focus more on specific muscle development, fat loss protocols, or physique-oriented goals.

### Enjoyment & Psychological Benefits (15%)
The pleasure, mental health benefits, and positive experiences derived from physical activity. This includes stress reduction, mood enhancement, community connection, and the inherent satisfaction of movement itself. Those who prioritise this value select activities they genuinely enjoy and that support their mental wellbeing.
