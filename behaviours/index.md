# Behaviours

## What are Behaviours?

Behaviours encompasses the unconscious, automatic patterns of action that often work against your wellbeing and life goals. This includes addictions, compulsions, emotional reactions, avoidance patterns, and deeply ingrained responses that you engage in despite knowing they're counterproductive. Unlike habits (which are deliberately cultivated positive patterns), behaviours in this context are typically reactive patterns that emerge as coping mechanisms or responses to unmet emotional needs.

This life area focuses on recognising these automatic patterns, understanding their triggers, and developing the capacity to choose different responses. It covers everything from substance use and compulsive behaviours to emotional reactivity and problematic interpersonal patterns that limit your freedom and authentic expression.

## Why Behaviours Matter

Automatic behavioural patterns significantly impact every aspect of life, often determining the difference between living reactively versus responding intentionally. <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-freedom')">i</span> These unconscious responses can undermine relationships, career progress, and personal wellbeing, whilst conscious behavioural choice enhances self-efficacy and life satisfaction.

The ability to regulate emotional responses and break free from compulsive patterns correlates strongly with mental health outcomes and relationship quality. <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-emotional')">i</span> People who develop sophisticated behavioural awareness and intervention skills report significantly greater life satisfaction and resilience during challenging periods. <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('research-resilience')">i</span>

## Behaviour Values

Your optimal approach to behaviours depends on what aspects of change you value most. This guide balances four core values, with percentages indicating the relative weight given to each in our recommendations.

For personalised recommendations based on your unique priorities, visit [Behaviours Personalised]({{ site.baseurl }}/behaviours/personalised), where you can adjust these value weightings to see which interventions work best for your specific goals and preferences.

### Freedom & Control (25%)
Liberation from compulsive patterns and automatic responses that limit your individual choices. This includes breaking free from addictions, managing impulses, and developing the ability to pause between trigger and response. People who prioritise this value focus on interventions that restore genuine choice in their actions, even when it requires significant upfront effort or temporary discomfort.

### Emotional Regulation (30%)
Developing healthier responses to emotional triggers like stress, anxiety, anger, or boredom. This encompasses moving from reactive emotional patterns to more measured, intentional responses. Those who prioritise this value focus on building emotional skills and alternative coping strategies, accepting that feeling emotions fully may be temporarily more difficult than numbing them.

### Social & Relational Patterns (25%)
Changing automatic interpersonal behaviours like people-pleasing, conflict avoidance, codependency, social withdrawal, or defensive reactions. This involves learning to respond rather than react in relationships and developing healthier patterns of connection. People who prioritise this value work on assertiveness, boundary-setting, and staying present during difficult social situations.

### Resilience & Adaptability (20%)
Building sustainable behavioural change that survives life disruptions and doesn't require constant vigilance. This includes developing multiple coping strategies, planning for setbacks, and creating robust systems rather than fragile single approaches. Those who prioritise this value are willing to progress more slowly to ensure changes last permanently through major life transitions or crises.

## Benchmarks by Level

Research reveals that most people have problematic behavioural patterns but rarely address them systematically. Studies show that only 23.6% of those needing behavioural intervention actually seek help, with most people maintaining automatic patterns throughout life without systematic change attempts. Recovery and emotional regulation success rates vary widely, but sustained behavioural mastery represents achievement by only the top percentiles of the population. These patterns mean that even modest improvements in behavioural self-management represent higher population percentiles than might initially be expected.

### Level 1: Awareness

**Freedom & Control**: Recognise specific patterns where you act compulsively or automatically against your better judgment, identifying 2-3 primary triggers that lead to unwanted behaviours <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-freedom')">i</span>

**Emotional Regulation**: Notice emotional states that typically lead to problematic behaviours and understand the connection between specific feelings and your reactive patterns <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-emotional')">i</span>

**Social & Relational Patterns**: Identify your default interpersonal responses during conflict or social pressure, recognising automatic patterns like people-pleasing, withdrawal, or defensiveness <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-social')">i</span>

**Resilience & Adaptability**: Assess which current coping strategies are sustainable versus which tend to fail during challenging periods or major life changes <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level1-resilience')">i</span>

### Level 2: Foundation (80th percentile capability)

**Freedom & Control**: Successfully interrupt problematic patterns 60-70% of the time when noticed, maintaining basic environmental modifications that reduce exposure to major triggers <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-freedom')">i</span>

**Emotional Regulation**: Use 2-3 healthy coping strategies effectively during emotional triggers, with stress-driven reactive behaviours occurring no more than 2-3 times weekly during normal periods <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-emotional')">i</span>

**Social & Relational Patterns**: Express basic needs and boundaries in most relationships without excessive anxiety, avoiding major people-pleasing or conflict-avoidance behaviours in routine situations <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-social')">i</span>

**Resilience & Adaptability**: Maintain behavioural improvements for 3-6 months consistently, including through minor life stressors, with clear plans for handling predictable high-risk situations <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level2-resilience')">i</span>

### Level 3: Proficiency (95th percentile capability)

**Freedom & Control**: Maintain freedom from compulsive behaviours 85-90% of the time, with rare lapses being brief and quickly corrected rather than leading to extended cycles <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-freedom')">i</span>

**Emotional Regulation**: Respond rather than react to emotional triggers in most situations, using sophisticated regulation techniques and maintaining stability during moderately stressful periods <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-emotional')">i</span>

**Social & Relational Patterns**: Navigate conflict and social pressure with assertiveness and emotional regulation, maintaining authentic responses even in challenging interpersonal dynamics <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-social')">i</span>

**Resilience & Adaptability**: Sustain behavioural changes through major life transitions with only temporary disruptions that are quickly restored <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level3-resilience')">i</span>

### Level 4: Excellence (99th percentile capability)

**Freedom & Control**: Demonstrate consistent choice and intentionality across all life domains, with automatic problematic patterns being rare exceptions rather than ongoing struggles <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-freedom')">i</span>

**Emotional Regulation**: Maintain emotional equilibrium and healthy responses even during high-stress periods, major crises, or when multiple stressors occur simultaneously <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-emotional')">i</span>

**Social & Relational Patterns**: Navigate highly challenging social situations with consistent authenticity and healthy boundaries, maintaining equilibrium even when others are highly reactive <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-social')">i</span>

**Resilience & Adaptability**: Adapt behavioural strategies effectively to completely new environments or circumstances while maintaining core healthy patterns <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level4-resilience')">i</span>

### Level 5: Mastery (99.9th percentile capability)

**Freedom & Control**: Maintain complete freedom from compulsive patterns even during extreme stress, major crises, or prolonged difficult circumstances <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-freedom')">i</span>

**Emotional Regulation**: Demonstrate exceptional regulation capabilities that remain stable regardless of external circumstances, maintaining healthy responses even during trauma or major loss <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-emotional')">i</span>

**Social & Relational Patterns**: Navigate the most challenging interpersonal situations with consistent authenticity, maintaining equilibrium even when others are highly manipulative or reactive <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-social')">i</span>

**Resilience & Adaptability**: Sustain optimal behavioural patterns through any life circumstance, adapting strategies seamlessly while maintaining core principles and demonstrating extraordinary psychological flexibility <span class="info-icon" onclick="showReasoning('level5-resilience')">i</span>
